      "the judgment was delivered by c k thakker j\n",
      "1 leave granted\n",
      "2 the present appeal is directed against judgment and order passed by the division bench of the high court of chhattisgarh on may 04 2005 in writ petition no 283 of 2001 by the said order the high court dismissed the writ petition filed by the appellantpetitioner and confirmed the order passed by the madhya pradesh state cooperative tribunal bhopal on january 22 2001 in second appeal no560 of 1999\n",
      "3 short facts giving rise to the present appeal are that the appellant herein was working as manager in the large area multi purpose society lamps for short between august 1977 and august 1981 the appellant was the manager in the schedule tribe service cooperative society kanker he at that time committed financial irregularities disciplinary proceedings were initiated against him and by an order dated april 29 1982 passed by the chairman district cooperative central bank ltd jagdalpur bastar he was removed from service\n",
      "4 the appellant preferred a departmental appeal on april 30 1982 since he had not been communicated anything as to what had happened to the said appeal the appellant on june 30 1982 filed an application us 55 of the madhya pradesh co operative societies act 1960 hereinafter referred to as the act to the joint registrar cooperative societies raipur\n",
      "5 according to the appellant the application was made to the joint registrar raipur as district bastarjagdalpur was within the territorial jurisdiction of raipur as stated by the petitioner joint registrar then came to be appointed for district bastar for jagdalpur area another application was therefore made on october 08 1985 by the petitioner before the joint registrar cooperative societies jagdalpur on february 19 1986 the joint registrar jagdalpur dismissed the application filed by the petitioner as time barred the appellant preferred an appeal against the said order before the board of revenue gwalior however the said appeal was also dismissed by the board on june 14 1990\n",
      "6 on october 22 1990 the application filed by the petitioner on june 30 1982 before the joint registrar raipur was forwarded to deputy registrar kanker for adjudication the deputy registrar kanker treated the case as within the period of limitation considered it on merits and set aside the order of removal vide his order dated may 18 1994 he also directed the bank to pay all dues to the applicant\n",
      "7 the respondent bank challenged the said order by approaching the state co operative tribunal the tribunal allowed the appeal filed by the bank on the ground of res judicata observing that an application filed by the appellant was dismissed by joint registrar jagdalpur and the said order was confirmed by the board of revenue gwalior dismissing the appeal which had become final\n",
      "8 the appellant being aggrieved by the order passed by the tribunal preferred writ petition no 283 of 2001 in the high court of chhatisgarh which as stated above was dismissed by the high court the said order is challenged in the present appeal\n",
      "9 on july 06 2006 notice was issued to the respondents affidavitinreply and affidavitinrejoinder were thereafter filed an order was passed directing the registry to place the matter for final hearing and that is how the matter has been placed before us\n",
      "10 we have heard the learned counsel for the parties\n",
      "11 the learned counsel for the appellant contended that the tribunal as well as the high court were wrong in dismissing the claim of the appellant it was contended that the tribunal was not right in holding that the appeal filed by the appellant was barred by res judicata the high court was therefore right in observing that the tribunal committed an error of law in treating the appeal as barred by res judicata\n",
      "the high court however went wrong in not allowing the writ petition and in coming to the conclusion that the application filed by the appellantpetitioner us 55 of the act was barred by limitation and the registrar had no power authority or jurisdiction to entertain such dispute the counsel contended that when the matter came up before the tribunal it was stated on behalf of the respondentbank through its counsel that the application was within time and hence it was decided on merits thereafter it was not open to the bank to contend that the application was beyond time and delay could not be condoned\n",
      "12 the learned counsel submitted that even on merits the case did not call for punishment of removal certain allegations were made and even if it is assumed for the sake of argument that all the allegations were true the appellant could not have been removed from service no financial loss has been caused to the respondentbank the appellant has enormously suffered and he is out of employment since more than fifteen years\n",
      "hence even if this court comes to the conclusion that proceedings could have been initiated against the appellant and he could have been punished on the facts and in the circumstances of the case this court may direct the bank to re instate the appellant without back wages so that the appellant as well as his family members would not be deprived of livelihood and would not starve\n",
      "13 the learned counsel for the respondentbank on the other hand supported the order passed by the tribunal and confirmed by the high court it was contended that the high court was right in holding that the application filed by the appellant was barred by limitation the counsel urged that the act provides by laying down maximum period of limitation beyond which no application can be entertained by the registrar if it is so no grievance can be made if the application filed by the appellant was treated as barred by time\n",
      "14 the counsel did not seriously challenge the view taken by the authorities that the application could not be dismissed on the ground of res judicata but submitted that the application was time barred\n",
      "15 the counsel also submitted that the deputy registrar cooperative societies kanker was not right when he stated that consent was given by the counsel appearing on behalf of the bank that the application filed by the appellant us 55 of the act be treated within time and the application was admitted the counsel however stated that even if the counsel for the bank had stated that the application submitted by the appellant could be treated within the period of limitation such concession being concession against law would not bind the bank if the statute stipulates a particular period of limitation no concession or order would make an application barred by time to be within the limitation and the authority had no jurisdiction to consider such application on merits\n",
      "16 on merits the counsel urged that considering the totality of facts and circumstances particularly charges levelled against the appellant and proved at the inquiry which related to financial irregularities if the appellant was removed from service it cannot be said that no order of removal could have been passed the appellant was a bank employee and holding the office of manager a position of trust it is in the light of the said fact that his case was required to be considered which was done and punishment was imposed\n",
      "17 having heard the learned counsel for the parties and having applied our mind to the facts and circumstances of the case in our opinion the appeal filed by the appellant deserves to be dismissed the high court has not committed any error of law which requires to be interfered with in exercise of discretionary and equitable jurisdiction uart 136 of the constitution\n",
      "18 so far as res judicata is concerned in our opinion the appellant is right in submitting that the tribunal was not justified in holding that the application filed by the appellant was barred by res judicata it is clear from the facts stated hereinabove that the application was filed by the appellant to joint registrar raipur it was pending\n",
      "meanwhile however district bastar had its own registry and hence an application was submitted to district registrar bastar the application preferred by the appellant to the joint registrar raipur in the circumstances became infructuous it was not decided on merits\n",
      "19 as per settled law such decision does not operate as res judicata the high court was therefore right in coming to the conclusion that the tribunal was in error in dismissing the application on the ground of res judicata that part of the order passed by the tribunal was therefore rightly not approved by the high court\n",
      "20 but so far as limitation is concerned admittedly the disciplinary proceedings culminated against the appellant in an order of removal such order was passed on april 29 1982 an application against the said order was made for the first time by the appellant applicant on june 30 1982 ie after more than two months\n",
      "21 now s 55 of the act empowers the registrar to determine conditions of employment in societies the said section as it then stood read as under\n",
      "55 registrars power to determine conditions of employment in societies\n",
      "1 the registrar may from time to time frame rules governing the terms and conditions of employment in a society or class of societies and the society or class of societies to which such terms and conditions of employment are applicable shall comply with the order that may be issued by the registrar in this behalf\n",
      "provided that in the case of co operative credit structure the registrar may frame rules governing the terms and conditions of employment on the basis of the guidelines specified by the national bank\n",
      "2 where a dispute including a dispute regarding terms of employment working conditions and disciplinary action taken by a society arises between a society and its employees the registrar or any officer appointed by him not below the rank of assistant registrar shall decide the dispute and his decision shall be binding on the society and its employees\n",
      "provided that the registrar or the officer referred to above shall not entertain the dispute unless presented to him within thirty days from the date of order sought to be impugned\n",
      "provided further that in computing the period of limitation under the foregoing proviso the time requisite for obtaining copy of the order shall be exclused emphasis supplied\n",
      "22 plain reading of the aforesaid provision makes it more than clear that when a dispute regarding terms of employment working conditions and disciplinary action taken by a society and its employees arises the officer specified therein will decide such dispute which shall be binding on the society and its employees the first proviso to subs 2 of the said section prohibits the registrar from entertaining the dispute unless such dispute is presented to him within thirty days from the date of the order impugned\n",
      "23 the second proviso declares that in computing the period of limitation the time requisite for obtaining copy of the order would be excluded it is thus clear that if an employee aggrieved by any decision taken by the society intends to approach the registrar he must invoke provisions of s 55 of the act by filing an application within thirty days from the date of such order or action\n",
      "24 in the instant case admittedly the order of removal was passed by the bank against the appellant on april 29 1982 even the first petition us 55 of the act was filed by the appellantapplicant on june 30 1982 ie after two months which was time barred the high court considered the first petition filed by the appellant herein before the registrar raipur but even that petition was barred by time the high court was therefore right in dismissing the writ petition holding that the application filed by the applicant was not within the period of limitation prescribed by s 55 of the act\n",
      "25 learned counsel for the appellant however submitted that the petition filed by the applicant ought to have been treated within the period of limitation in support of such contention he relied on two aspects\n",
      "26 firstly the provisions of appeals and revisions under the act chapter x provides for filing of appeals and revisions referring to rule making power of the state section 95 the counsel submitted that the state government has power to prescribe procedure in presenting and disposal of appeals cl gg of sub s 2 of s 95 in exercise of the said power the state government has framed rules known as the madhya pradesh cooperative societies rules 1962 hereinafter referred to as the rules chapter ix as then stood provided procedure in appeals and revisions rule 59 of the rules laid down procedure in filing an appeal to the state government or to the registrar subrules 6 7 and 8 to which our attention has been invited by the learned counsel read thus\n",
      "6 if the appellate authority finds that the appeal presented does not conform to any of the said provisions it shall make a notice on the appeal to that effect and may call upon the appellant or his agent to remedy the defects within a period of seven days of the receipt of the notice to do so or in case the appeal has not been presented within the prescribed time limit to show cause within the said period of seven days why it should not be dismissed as timebarred by the appellate authority\n",
      "7 if the defect is remedies or the cause shown by the appellant or his agent satisfies the appellate authority the appellate authority may proceed to consider the appeal\n",
      "8 if the appellant or his agent fails to remedy the defects or to show cause to the satisfaction of the appellate authority within the said period the appellate authority may if the appeal is not presented within the timelimit dismiss the appeal as time barred in cases where it is considered necessary to give a hearing the appellate authority may fix a date for hearing of which due notice shall be given to the appellant or his agent\n",
      "27 we are of the view that the aforesaid provisions do not apply to the case on hand apart from the fact that rule 59 merely lays down procedure of appeals instituted within the period of limitation and provides for removal of defects neither the provisions relating to appeals nor of revisions apply to the case on hand\n",
      "28 in our view the scheme of the act is clear chapter x of the parent act which deals with appeals and revisions applies to those cases where orders have been passed by the authorities and officers under the act and a person is aggrieved by such orders in the present case the action is taken not by an authority or officer under the act but by the respondentbank the appellant therefore rightly applied to the registrar us 55 of the act complaining against such action\n",
      "29 the appellant could not have preferred an appeal under the act either to the registrar or to the state tribunal the provisions of chapter x of the act relating to appeals and procedure laid down in chapter ix of the rules therefore had no application the first ground in support of the application that it should be treated as within the period of limitation has thus no force\n",
      "30 secondly the appellant contended that the learned counsel appearing for the bank conceded that the application filed by the appellantapplicant was within time and hence the registrar took up for consideration the said application and decided on merits\n",
      "thereafter it was not open to the bank to contend that the application was barred by limitation the order of the high court therefore deserves to be set aside it was also submitted that had it been contended before the registrar that the application was not within the period of limitation prescribed by law the appellant could have satisfied the authority or would have taken other steps but he was deprived by the concession on behalf of the bank it has caused serious prejudice to the appellant and the bank cannot be allowed to blow hot and cold by taking inconsistent pleas and by raising technical defence of limitation\n",
      "31 the learned counsel for the respondentbank rightly submitted that the plea raised by the appellant has no force it was submitted that there was no concession by the bank relying on zimni the counsel submitted that on july 06 1993 ie the day on which the concession was said to have been made the presiding officer was not present as he was on a tour no proceeding took place on that day it was therefore factually incorrect to state that a concession was made on behalf of the bank and it did not object that the application was barred by time\n",
      "32 but even otherwise according to the counsel if the application was not within the period of limitation the socalled concession would neither bind the bank nor invest jurisdiction or power in the authority to entertain such application which was barred by limitation in other words according to the counsel the concession was against the provision of law which would not bind the bank\n",
      "33 now limitation goes to the root of the matter if a suit appeal or application is barred by limitation a court or an adjudicating authority has no jurisdiction power or authority to entertain such suit appeal or application and to decide it on merits\n",
      "34 subs 1 of s 3 of the limitation act 1963 reads as under\n",
      "3 bar of limitation1 subject to the provisions contained in ss 4 to 24 inclusive every suit instituted appeal preferred and application made after the prescribed period shall be dismissed although limitation has not been set up as a defence emphasis supplied\n",
      "35 bare reading of the aforesaid provision leaves no room for doubt that if a suit is instituted appeal is preferred or application is made after the prescribed period it has to be dismissed even though no such plea has been raised or defence has been set up in other words even in absence of such plea by the defendant respondent or opponent the court or authority must dismiss such suit appeal or application if it is satisfied that the suit appeal or application is barred by limitation\n",
      "36 as stated earlier s 55 allows an aggrieved party to approach the registrar within a period of thirty days there is no provision analogous to s 5 of the limitation act 1963 allowing the registrar to condone delay if sufficient cause is shown\n",
      "in view of this fact in our opinion the contention of the learned counsel for the bank is well founded that the application submitted by the appellant was barred by time\n",
      "37 to us the high court was right in observing that the tribunal was in error in allowing the appeal and dismissing the claim of the appellant on the ground of res judicata the high court therefore considered the said question independently and held that the bank was right in submitting that the appellant had not approached the registrar within the period prescribed by law and his application was liable to be dismissed\n",
      "38 so far as the prayer by the appellant that he has sufficiently suffered and should be reinstated in service without back wages also cannot be accepted the appellant was holding position of trust and was manager of a bank\n",
      "39 the charges leveled against him were serious in nature concerning misappropriation of money it is true that the amount was not big and it was also repaid and the bank has not suffered but even then the manager of a cooperative bank was involved in financial irregularities the bank was satisfied that he should not be retained in service and passed an order of removal\n",
      "40 in our opinion by no stretch of imagination it can be said that such punishment is grossly disproportionate or excessively high normally in exercise of power of judicial review a writ court will not substitute its own judgment or decision for the judgment or decision of a disciplinary authority unless it comes to the conclusion that it has shocked the conscience of the court or the punishment is such that no reasonable man would impose such punishment or in the words of lord scarman in notinghamshire county council v secretary of state 1986 ac 240  1986 1 all er 199 that the decision is so absurd that one is satisfied that the decision maker at the time of making decision must have taken leave of his senses\n",
      "41 in our considered opinion the case does not fall in any of the categories enumerated by the courts in several cases we therefore see no infirmity even in the final decision taken by the bank which deserves interference by this court\n",
      "42 for the foregoing reasons the appeal deserves to be dismissed and is dismissed however without any order as to costs\n",

      "appeal cr 688 of 1995\n",
      "the judgment was delivered by  ruma pal j\n",
      "1 the appellant was found guilty of an offence us 138 of the negotiable instruments act 1881 by the special court set up under the special court trial of offences relating to transactions in securities act 1992 referred to as the act the appellant was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for a term of one year and a fine for a sum of rs 1 lakh in default to undergo further rigorous imprisonment for a term of three months aggrieved by the judgment and order of the special court the appellant has preferred this appeal\n",
      "2 in the course of the hearing of the appeal before this court learned counsel for the appellant raised a preliminary issue based on the language of sub s 2 of s 3 of the act it was contended that the jurisdiction of the special court was limited to offences committed between 1 april 1991 and on or before 6 june 1992 and the offence alleged having taken place after 6 june 92 the special court had no jurisdiction to try it the bench then hearing the appeal recorded in its order dated 7 sepetember 1999\n",
      "   prima facie we are not in agreement with the contention raised by the learned counsel for the appellant on first principles but the learned counsel for the appellant has brought to our notice a judgment of this court in the case of minoo mehta vs sharak d mehta 1998 2 scc 418 1998 indlaw sc 438 in the aforesaid judgment on facts of that case this question possibly did not arise for consideration but even otherwise their lordships have come to the conclusion \n",
      "therefore every offence pertaining to any transaction in securities which is covered by the sweep of the act that is if such transaction has taken place between 1 april 1991 and on or before 6 june 1992 would be subjected to the provisions of the act regarding trial of such an offence\n",
      "having held so in the later part of the said paragraph the lordships have come to the conclusion\n",
      "the offence referred to in subs 2 of s 3 which is within the sweep of s 7 of the act must be on offence committed by any person and must have the following two characteristics\n",
      "such offence must relate to transactions in securities and\n",
      "such offence should be alleged to have been committed between 1april 1991 and on or before 6 june 1992\n",
      "this statement of law is contrary to what their lordships have said in the earlier paragraph as referred to earlier and we are not in agreement with the enunciation made in the second part of above in this view of the matter we think it appropriate that this appeal should be placed before a 3judge bench\n",
      "the matter was thereafter placed before this bench and heard\n",
      "3 the apparently contradictory observations in minoo mehta v shavak d mehta 1998 indlaw sc 438 need resolution with reference to the provisions of the act\n",
      "the act was promulgated on 6 june 92 to provide for the establishment of a special court for the trial of offences relating to transactions in securities and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto\n",
      "4 the jurisdiction of the special court was specified in s 7 and was limited to offences referred to in s 32 of theact s 32 insofar as it is relevant provides\n",
      " any offence relating to transactions in securities after the 1 day of april 1991 and on and before 6th june 1992\n",
      "5 the question is  does the period specified qualify the word offence or the word transactions  if it is the former the jurisdiction of the special court would be as contended by the appellant limited to offences committed within the period specified whenever the transactions may have taken place the respondent has however contended that the period qualifies the word transactions and that this was not only clear from the language of the statutory provisions but also supported by authority\n",
      "6 in our view the respondents submission is correct and must be accepted the statement of objects and reasons of theact gives the background and the focus of thract as \n",
      "large scale irregularities and malpractices were noticed in transactions in both the government and other securities indulged in by some brokers in collusion with the employees of various banks and financial institutions\n",
      "7 the preamble to thract also makes it clear that the purpose of the enactment was to deal with those particular transactions in securities in subs 2 of s 3 the statutory period occurs after the word transaction if the period were to qualify the word offence the section would have read any offence after the 1st day of april and on or before 6 june 1992 from the language used it is apparent that the period relates to the transaction in securities and that the date of the offence is immaterial other sections of theact also show that the object of act is those particular transactions which were carried out during a particular period of time thus s 4 of thrthe act allows the custodian under certain circumstances to cancel any contract or agreement entered into at any time after the first day of april 1991 and on or before the 6th june of 1992 the position has been further clarified by section 9a1b introduced by way of amendment in 1994 which confers on the special court all the jurisdiction powers and authority as were exercisable immediately before the commencement of the amended act by any civil court in relation to interalia any matter or claim \n",
      "arising out of transactions in securities entered into after the 1st day of april 1991 and on or before the 6th day of june 1992 in which a person is notified under sub s 2 of sec 3 is involved as a party broker intermediary or in any other manner\n",
      "8 in these circumstances the inevitable conclusion is that the ambit of the special courts jurisdiction whether in criminal proceedings or in civil disputes is in respect of the transactions in securities entered into after the 1st day of april 1991 and on or before 6th day of june 1992 that the period mentioned in s 32 refers to the transactions and not to the offence is a view which found favour with this court in harshad shantilal mehta v custodian and others 1998 indlaw sc 732 a bench of threejudges of this court after considering the various sections of theact held\n",
      "therefore the jurisdiction of the special court in civil as well as criminal matters is in respect of transactions during the statutory period of 1 april 1991 to 6 june 1992 and in relation to the properties attached of a notified person the entire operation of the said act therefore revolves around the transactions in securities during this statutory period\n",
      "9 in our opinion the decision in mino mehta v shavak d mehta 1998 indlaw sc 438 supra does not decide to the contrary in that case shares had been lodged with the accused by the complainant in december 1991 the accused was to arrange the sale of the shares and to pay the sale proceeds to the complainant in january 1992 the accused sold the shares and misappropriated the sale proceeds thus the transactions in securities as well as the offence of misappropriation had both taken place during the period specified in s 3 subs 2 the only issue before the court was whether the special court would have jurisdiction to deal with offences even if the accused was not notified by the custodian the learned judges decided the issue in the affirmative\n",
      "while reaching its conclusion the court observed\n",
      " the scheme of section 7 in the light of the preamble of theact and the main purpose for enactment of theact appears to be that all criminal proceedings pertaining to prosecutions in connection with the accused involved in transactions in securities during the relevant period will lie before the special court and not before ordinary courts as the section starts with a non obstante clause stating that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law only special courts will have exclusive jurisdiction to try such offences\n",
      "10 because the offence and the transactions overlapped the learned judges did not make a distinction between the transaction and the offence when they summed up their conclusions by saying \n",
      "the offence referred to in subs 2 of section 3 which is within the sweep of s 7 of theact must be an offence committed by any person and must have the following two characteristics\n",
      "such offence should be alleged to have been committed between 1 april 1991 and on or before 6 june 1992 the use of the word offence in item 2 was an obvious error because what was meant has been made clear by the court in the judgment which reads before parting with this case we may state that the learned senior counsel for the appellant also submitted that the offence alleged against the appellant was not relating to any transaction in securities during the relevant time but qua the sale consideration alleged to have been received by the appellant out of the said transaction and for which alleged offence us 409 prosecution is sought to be launched against the appellant it is difficult to agree with this contention a conjoint reading of the recitals in the complaint which obviously must be assumed to be true at this stage would show that the accused is alleged to have entered into transaction in securities namely the shares during the relevant period and out of the said transaction is alleged to have received sale proceeds which he has not handed over or transmitted to the complainant who claims to be entitled to the said amount thus the offence alleged is certainly relating to the transaction in securities as said to have been entered into by the accused during the relevant period\n",
      "11 it is clear therefore that the summing up did not correctly reflect the actual view of the court in the present case the four cheques which are the subject matter of the criminal proceedings were admittedly executed by the appellant on 24 december 1991 26 december 1991 17 february 1992 and 27 march 1992 ie within the statutory period the cheques were drawn on the andhra bank in favour of the standard chartered bank briefly referred to as the bank for the sums of rs27 crores rs145 crores rs17 crores and rs199575000 respectively according to the bank the cheques were issued for payment of loss suffered by the bank arising out of transactions in securities entered into by the bank through or at the instance of the appellant during the statutory period according to the bank on 21 may 1992 all four cheques were returned dishonoured by the andhra bank with the remark not arranged for the bank served notices on the appellant us 138 of the negotiable instruments act on 31 may 1992 and 1 june 1992 calling upon the appellant to make payment in respect of the four cheques within 15 days from the date of the receipt of the notices the appellant did not pay the transactions as alleged being within the statutory period the special court had the jurisdiction to entertain the complaint and the preliminary objection of the appellant is in the circumstances rejected\n",
      "12 on the merits of the case also we do not find any reason to interfere with the decision of the special court in the complaint filed on behalf of the bank by one bratindranath banerjee the respondent herein on 14 july 1992 it was alleged that the appellant was acting as a broker in respect of security transactions between the bank and other banks and financial institutions according to the complaint the appellant had issued the four cheques in discharge of his liabilities to the bank the four cheques were presented to andhra bank but were dishonoured a first information report was lodged against the appellant and others in the written statement filed by the appellant us 247 of the code of criminal procedure it was said that pursuant to an oral information from the banks officer that the bank was working on some new scheme and methods of augmenting its income and request for assistance for the same the appellant agreed to certain formalities and adjustments as and when required pursuant to this arrangement the appellant had executed and sent several cheques to the bank including the four cheques ext b c d  e which related to certain intended transactions of purchase of security by the appellant from the standard chartered bank according to the appellant none of these intended transactions actually materialised and as a result the cheques were never to be acted upon or encashed it was denied that the appellant was liable to make any payment in respect of the four cheques according to the appellant although the transactions had not taken place and the cheques should have been returned the four cheques were not returned back to the appellant by the bank through oversight\n",
      "13 it is unnecessary to consider the various preliminary stages of the trial before the special court except to note that charges were framed on 26 august 1992 by the special court against the appellant us 138 of the negotiable instruments act 1881\n",
      "14 that the four cheques were executed by the appellant in favour of the standard chartered bank hereafter referred to as the bank has not been denied nor was it in dispute that the cheques were dishonoured because of insufficient funds in the appellants account with the drawee viz andhra bank because of the admitted execution of the four cheques by the appellant the bank was entitled to and did in fact rely upon three presumptions in support of its case namely under sections 118 138 and 139 of the negotiable instruments act s 118 provides interalia that until the contrary is proved it shall be presumed that every negotiable instrument was made or drawn for consideration and that every such instrument when it has been accepted indorsed negotiated or transferred was accepted indorsed negotiated or transferred for consideration the presumption which arises us 138 provides more specifically that where any cheque drawn by a person on an account for payment of any amount of money for the discharge in whole or in part of any debt or other liability is returned by the drawee bank unpaid either because of the amount of money standing to the credit of that account is insufficient to honour the cheque such persons shall be deemed to have committed an offence and shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque or with both the nature of the presumption us 138 is subject to the three conditions specified relating to presentation giving of the notice and the nonpayment after receipt of notice by the drawer of the cheque all three conditions have not been denied in this case\n",
      "15 the appellants submission that the cheques were not drawn for the discharge in whole or in part of any debt or other liability is answered by the third presumption available to the bank us 139 of the negotiable instruments act this section provides that it shall be presumed unless the contrary is proved that the holder of a cheque received the cheque of the nature referred to in s 138 for the discharge in whole or in part of any debt or other liability the effect of these presumptions is to place the evidential burden on the appellant of proving that the cheque was not received by the bank towards the discharge of any liability\n",
      "16 because both ss 138 and 139 require that the court shall presume the liability of the drawer of the cheques for the amounts for which the cheques are drawn as noted in state of madras vs a vaidyanatha iyer air 1958 sc 61 1957 indlaw sc 9 it is obligatory on the court to raise this presumption in every case where the factual basis for the raising of the presumption had been established it introduces an exception to the general rule as to the burden of proof in criminal cases and shifts the onus on to the accused such a presumption is a presumption of law as distinguished from a presumption of fact which describes provisions by which the court may presume a certain state of affairs presumptions are rules of evidence and do not conflict with the presumption of innocence because by the latter all that is meant is that the prosecution is obliged to prove the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt the obligation on the prosecution may be discharged with the help of presumptions of law or fact unless the accused adduces evidence showing the reasonable possibility of the nonexistence of the presumed fact\n",
      "17 in other words provided the facts required to form the basis of a presumption of law exists no discretion is left with the court but to draw the statutory conclusion but this does not preclude the person against whom the presumption is drawn from rebutting it and proving the contrary a fact is said to be proved when after considering the matters before it the court either believes it to exist or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ought under the circumstances of the particular case to act upon the supposition that it exists  therefore the rebuttal does not have to be conclusively established but such evidence must be adduced before the court in support of the defence that the court must either believe the defence to exist or consider its existence to be reasonably probable the standard of reasonability being that of the prudent man judicial statements have differed as to the quantum of rebutting evidence required in kundan lal rallaram vs custodian evacuee property bombay air 1961 sc 1316 1961 indlaw sc 528 this court held that the presumption of law under s 118 of negotiable instruments act could be rebutted in certain circumstances by a presumption of fact raised us 114 of the evidence act the decision must be limited to the facts of that case the more authoritative view has been laid down in the subsequent decision of the constitution bench in dhanvantrai balwantrai desai vs state of maharashtra air 1964 sc 575 1962 indlaw sc 82 where this court reiterated the principle enunciated in state of madras vs vaidyanath iyer supra and clarified that the distinction between the two kinds of presumption lay not only in the mandate to the court but also in the nature of evidence required to rebut the two in the case of a discretionary presumption the presumption if drawn may be rebutted by an explanation which might reasonably be true and which is consistent with the innocence of the accused on the other hand in the case of a mandatory presumption the burden resting on the accused person in such a case would not be as light as it is where a presumption is raised under s114 of the evidence act and cannot be held to be discharged merely by reason of the fact that the explanation offered by the accused is reasonable and probable it must further be shown that the explanation is a true one the words unless the contrary is proved which occur in this provision make it clear that the presumption has to be rebutted by proof and not by a bare explanation which is merely plausible a fact is said to be proved when its existence is directly established or when upon the material before it the court finds its existence to be so probable that a reasonable man would act on the supposition that it exists unless therefore the explanation is supported by proof the presumption created by the provision cannot be said to be rebutted\n",

      "18 we will therefore have to consider whether in the case before us the appellant had supported his defence by any proof sufficient to rebut the presumption drawn against him at the trial three witnesses were examined in support of the banks case the first was a mr derek reed pw 1 the banks group security adviser mr reed deposed that he had come to india with instructions from the bank to investigate the fraud which appeared to have been perpetrated in bombay in which several banks including the bank were involved in the course of investigation he found the four cheques ext b c d  e from the desk of an officer of the bank who has since been dismissed because of his involvement in the fraud\n",
      "19 the banks second witness was mr s gyananavinayagam pw2he was the manager operations in andhra bank he deposed that the four cheques were dishonoured on the ground of insufficient funds in the appellants account the third witness mr bratindra nath banerjee pw 3 was the director of the bank incharge of the india task force set up by the bank to investigate the fraud his was the primary evidence relied upon by the bank broadly speaking mr banerjee deposed that there were two main areas of fraud perpetrated by the appellant according to him the first fraud committed by the appellant related to large amounts paid by the bank at the instance of the appellant or through him for which the bank had failed to receive any security or valid bank receipts the second fraud pertained to the actual purchase and sale of securities at the instance of the appellant and the failure of the appellant to pay the bank the difference between the contract rate and delivery rate of the securities he verified the statements pertaining to the transactions between the appellant and the bank prepared on the basis of the banks books of account and other records maintained in the usual course of the business of the bank all the statements ex o p q and t were tendered in evidence and marked as exhibits without any objection by the appellant\n",
      "20 the first statement pertained to the period between 8 november 1991 and 18 december 1991 and showed the contract rates delivery rates the rates of difference and the amount of difference of securities mentioned the statement along with the deal slips cost memos instruction issued by the reserve bank of india and entry in a clearing sheet in respect of four deal slips were marked as ext o out of ext o difference of rates covered by four deal slips had been settled by the appellant by giving a cheque for rs15 crores the balance amount on this account was rs457740250 the second statement prepared and vouched for by mr banerjee was ext p prepared in connection with transactions between 28 december 1991 and 17 february 1992 the statement was supported by 18 deal slips the liability of the appellant on this account was claimed to be rs565050000 ext p was subsequently corrected by ext t which gave the figure of appellants liability for the period covered by ext p as rs395050000 the third statement was marked as ext q this gave particulars of the claim for the period 21 february 1992 to 27 march 1992 the appellants liability for this period was claimed to be rs309734135 ext q was supported by five deal slips\n",
      "21 all the deal slips which were printed forms and serially numbered showed the contract rate and the delivery rates they were prepared by dealers of the bank mr banerjee also stated that the use of the abbreviation dir in the column which required the name of the broker referred to the appellant the witness also showed that in respect of certain transactions where the contract rate was less than the delivery rate the appellant was paid by the bank in dealing with the appellants case namely that the cheques had been given for intended deals which had never taken place mr banerjee said that he had gone through all the deal slips which had been brought with him to the court and that there was no evidence of any cancellation of any deal between the appellant and the bank\n",
      "22 in the course of his examination mr banerjee also gave evidence of payment made by the bank to the appellant amounting to rs1240 crores and of the loss suffered by the bank on account of the nonfurnishing of bank receiptssecurities\n",
      "23 two further witnesses were produced by the bank one proved the appellants account with the bank and the second proved the appellants account with andhra bank for the relevant period\n",
      "24 as far as the appellants defence was concerned he did not enter the witness box to support his case that the four cheques in particular had been given in respect of any arrangement or in respect of any transactions which did not materialise the four witnesses called by the appellant apart from those subpoenaed to produce documents were mr ramesh laxman kamat dw 1 mr sr a rao dw 2 mr g d bhalla dw 3 and mr g ckc talukdar dw 4 the special court found that the evidence of dw 1 was not creditworthy and that almost all points including inconsequential points and points which could not be denied he prevaricated  and  sought to deny the truth until truth could no longer be denied dw 1 was then a deputy general manager of the state bank of india referred to as sbi he had sought to contend that a number of transactions mentioned in the four statements viz exs o p and q were ready forward transactions between the bank and sbi and did not reflect the sale and purchase of securities it was a case which he was unable to substantiate with reference to the documents already on record or produced from the custody of the cbi the documents produced by the witness himself were found by the special court to be suspect\n",
      "25 the second witness for the defence mr sra rao also sought to establish that one transaction in exo was non existent or a dummy transaction the third defence witnessmr gd bhalla branch manager of andhra bank proved that the appellant had made payments of several crores to the bank\n",
      "26 the fourth witness gk talukdar a staff officer of the reserve bank of india produced a list stipulating contract rates of several securities in an attempt to show that the contract rates claimed by the bank were not correct it was not stated that the list applied to the bank or that other rates could not be contracted for\n",
      "27 the brunt of the evidence given by the appellants witnesses was as to the nature of the transactions between the appellant and the bank however not one of the defence witnesses gave any evidence in support of the only defence of the appellant namely that the four cheques in question had been given towards intended transactions which did not take place no one said why the appellant had executed and delivered the particular cheques to the bank or that the appellant had not given the four cheques to discharge his debts to the bank nor did any defence witness claim that the cheques were given an account of any ready forward transactions in fact dw 1 in cross examination admitted that it was not the practice of a purchasing party to hand over cheques in advance the appellant alone could have said why he had admittedly executed the four cheques handed them over to the bank and never asked for their return he did not choose to do so\n",
      "as said by the special court \n",
      "thus according to the accused the cheques exs b and c were delivered on 23 december 1991 this ostensibly was for intended purchases of 2 crores and 108 crores units according to him the cheque ex d was given on 17 february 1992 this ostensibly for intended purchase of 12250000 units the ex was allegedly given on 27th march 1992 for intended purchase of 7 crore units of can star and 10 crore units of can premium apart from what is stated in the written statement there is no evidence or proof in support of this case\n",
      "28 the burden was on the appellant to disapprove the presumptions under ss 138 and 139 a burden which he failed to discharge at all the averment in the written statement of the appellant was not enough incidentally the defence in the written statement that the four cheques were given for intended transactions was not the answer given by the appellant to the notice us 138 then he had said that the cheques were given to assist the bank for restructuring exh it was necessary for the appellant at least to show on the basis of acceptable evidence either that his explanation in the written statement was so probable that a prudent man ought to accept it or to establish that the effect of the material brought on the record in its totality rendered the existence of the fact presumed improbable vide trilok chand jain vs state of delhi 1975 4 scc 761 1975 indlaw sc 220  the appellant has done neither in the absence of any such proof the presumptions under ss 138 and 139 must prevail\n",
      "29 we may also mention here that in proceedings initiated by the bank to recover monies from the appellant in connection with the first area of fraud mentioned by b banerjee pw 3 this court in standard chartered bank vs custodian 2000 6 scc 427 2000 indlaw sc 276 upholding the decision of the special court found that the appellant was liable to pay the bank a sum of rs28000 crores which is several times the amount covered by the four cheques in question the argument of the appellant before the special court that no offence us 138 had in fact been committed because he could not have paid within the period of 15 days after receipt of the notice even if he wanted to was rightly rejected the appellants submission was based on the fact that he had been notified by the custodian us 3 of theact and all his properties had consequently stood attached but as observed by the learned special court the special court had before it a number of applications by a number of parties asking for permission to fulfill their obligations under contracts in some cases the court had granted them there was nothing which prevented the appellant from applying to the special court for permission to fulfill his obligations or to pay off his debts under the cheques exs b c d  e no attempt had bean make by the appellant to make any payment towards the dishonoured cheques the appellant would not have paid even if he could have this is clear not only from the correspondence and the appellants conduct but also from his defence of total denial of liability the argument was therefore wholly academic\n",
      "30 the special court found the appellants defence improbable and the evidence adduced at his instance flawed and unbelievable after meticulously scanning both the oral and documentary evidence and ultimately drawing on the presumptions statutorily provided under sections 118 138 and 139 of the negotiable instruments act the appellant was found guilty for the reasons stated earlier there is no ground for us to decide differently and to differ from the view taken by the special court in holding the appellant guilty of the offence with which he was charged we therefore affirm the conviction and sentence imposed on the appellant by the special court and dismiss the appeal with costs assessed at rs10000\n",

      "21  it is argued by the learned counsel for the respondent that if the delay is condoned and relief is granted to the appellant the respondent had to bear the brunt of paying huge arrears of salary and other monetary benefits and secondly direction to pay arrears of wages is not automatic and it depends on several factors the learned counsel has drawn our attention to the observation made by this court in the case of gm tank vs state of gujarat 2006 indlaw sc 219 wherein this court has stated \n",

      "accordingly she gave the same to her thereafter the deceasedchild went to the mill and asked the appellant whether the grains were grinded at that time she was taken to the back side of the mill by the appellant since the deceased child did not return pw3 having waited for some time went home it is the further case of the prosecution that the appellant took the deceased child to the backyard which was seen by an employee pw12 of the mill the appellant permitted pw12 to go for lunch and pw12 left for lunch\n",

      "6 it is contended on behalf of the appellant that the prosecution has failed to comply with mandatory procedures as required us 1741 and 2 of crpc ie non sending of the intimation recorded us 1741 and the report us 174 2 of crpc reasonable suspicion on death to the nearest executive magistrate or subdivisional magistrate who is empowered to hold preliminary inquest enquiry and such irregularities on the part of the investigating agency vitiates the entire proceedings us 461 of crpc mr s mahendran learned counsel for the appellant placed reliance upon the judgment of this court in raj kumar singh v state of rajasthan 2013 5 scc 722 2013 indlaw sc 295 regarding not naming the accused in the fir is fatal to the prosecution case it is further contended that this case is based on the circumstantial evidence on which the trial court as well as the first appellate court while considering the said evidence on record have relied upon and convicted and sentenced the appellant for offences charged against him\n",
      "therefore the benefit of doubt is available to the accused which should have been adopted and the courts below should have passed the order of acquittal in support of the aforesaid submission he has placed reliance upon judgment of this court in the case of baldev singh v state of haryana 2008 14 scc 768 2008 indlaw sc 1894 and further contended that first charge of rape on the appellant is not proved automatically the second charge of murder us 302 ipc does not survive for consideration this aspect of the matter has not been considered properly by the courts below therefore the impugned judgment is liable to be set aside and further strong reliance was placed on the judgment in raghunath v state of haryana and anr 2003 1 scc 398 2002 indlaw sc 1397 in support of the contention that medical evidence does not support the prosecution case and hence the benefit of reasonable doubt shall go in favour of the appellant\n",
      "in support of this submission he also placed reliance upon the judgment of this court in devinder singh  ors v state of himachal pradesh 2003 11 scc 488 2003 indlaw sc 765 and another legal ground urged on behalf of the appellant is that the criminal court recognizes and accepts the inadmissible evidence therefore the finding recorded holding both charges proved against him is erroneous in law for want of accepting the inadmissible evidence therefore the said finding is liable to be set aside further reliance was placed on the evidence of the doctor pw15 who has stated that no external injuries were found on the deceasedchild therefore the question of death due to neurogenic shock is wholly untenable as the same is not supported by the doctors evidence\n",
      "7 it is further contended that the alleged recovery of the dead body of the deceasedchild from the well was required to be corroborated with medical evidence the same has not been proved by the prosecution and further the courts below have misdirected themselves with regard to the investigation made by pw21 and the circumstances placed on record on the basis of evidence of pws1 2 3 5 8 and 12 are nothing but improved versions therefore the courts below should not have placed reliance on such evidence to convict and sentence the appellant on the basis of said evidence which is not legally justified\n",
      "8 it is the case of the prosecution that the courts below failed to consider the vital evidence of the doctor pw15 during the examination inchief the doctor clearly stated that there is no symptom on the body which indicated drowning in water and the symptom found on the body could be that of wrinkling of skin and becoming pale etc that is why he has not mentioned this fact in his certificate on the suggestion made to him regarding non mentioning of rigor mortis found on the body the same was denied by him though he answered that he has not mentioned the same in the post mortem report but he conceded to the approximate time of death on the basis of rigor mortis found in the body and also admitted that he has not mentioned the external injuries found on the body as to whether they were ante or post mortem in nature he also suggested that normally in the first coitus abrasions contusions are possible on the vaginal part but in this case they are all absent\n",
      "further the courts below ignored the evidence namely the police inquest requisition to the doctor for conducting postmortem on the deceasedchild even on the police requisition it was not mentioned that it is the case of rape and murder according to the prosecution the dead body found in the well only legs were visible inside the well if that is so there should have been definite injury on the skull and other limbs but they are all absent in the case in hand as could be seen from the postmortem report which creates doubt on the alleged recovery of dead body from the well\n",
      "9 further the courts below have failed to consider the evidence of investigation officer pw21 who is the io in this case has brought several divergent facts among the prosecution witnesses which are believed by the courts below without proper analysis of the said evidence for convicting the appellant according to the investigation officer he arrested the appellant on 9112005 at akkalmadam bus stop which is contradictory with the evidence of pw12 colabour in the mill who had stated that he and the appellant were in police custody from 4112005 onwards later he was treated as prosecution witness\n",
      "therefore the alleged arrest of the appellant as stated by io in his evidence is not correct and further at the instance of the appellant the material object shawl alleged to have worn by the deceased was recovered however this fact and identity has not been elicited from any of the witnesses in their examination in chief he said that he examined the subinspector who registered an fir only on 9112005 ie after five days of the incident it is further stated by him that he saw the body firstly at government hospital mortuary however he admitted that if the body is brought to the hospital directly the particulars were recorded in an accident register and immediate intimation would be given to police station in the case in hand no such formalities have been complied with by the hospital authority\n",
      "when pw21 was questioned with regard to mentioning on column no 25 in exp21 he admitted that while going for having juice somebody cornered the girl and molested her inside the house but in the postmortem requisition he did not ask to conduct examination as to whether any rape has been committed on her at the same time he is not in a position to explain as to how he has mentioned these particulars in the inquest proceedings he further admitted that nazirdeen pw8 had alleged to have heard noise from the well and seen the appellant going on back side of the mill at 1030 pm the concerned house is a single room house and he has not mentioned either in his observation mahazar or in the rough sketch that the house consists of any backyard entry bathroom and latrine he further admitted that he has not mentioned that there is any backyard entry in the kathanjennas house who is alleged to have seen the body inside the well he had also further admitted that he has not prepared any observation mahazar or rough sketch about the inside of the mill though he examined the adjacent shop owners but those shops have not been shown in his observation mahazar it is further stated by him that during the course of enquiry pw1 has not stated that he did not receive any information from his mother in law he further admitted that pw3 has not stated anything about the appellant who collected things for grinding and returned the same\n",
      "10 further the courts below have not considered the evidence of pw3 who has stated in her second enquiry that her granddaughters slippers were found in front of kathuns house kathun jenna has not stated in any enquiry that she went to close the well with lid where she had seen two legs inside the well it is further contended that the trial court on wrong appreciation of evidence came to the erroneous conclusion on the charges to record its finding against the appellant on the basis of incredible and inconsistent circumstantial evidence the conviction recorded by the trial court for the simple reason that the appellant has confessed that after he ravished the deceased he threw the body inside the well and to corroborate the same the investigation officer has recovered a shawl at the instance of the appellant which is not admissible unless the recovery of shawl is proved from the other cogent evidence it is contended by the learned counsel that the conviction of the appellant is based on the basis of surmises and conjectures therefore he has prayed for setting aside the conviction and sentence awarded against him\n",
      "11 on the other hand mr myogesh kanna the learned counsel for the respondentprosecution sought to justify the concurrent findings and reasons recorded on the charges after proper analysis and reappreciation of evidence on record by both the trial court and the high court after careful examination of the evidence on record having regard to the charges levelled against the appellant he has placed reliance upon the judgment in raj kumar singh 2013 indlaw sc 295 supra wherein it is stated that not naming the accused in the fir does not vitiate the prosecution case and he further placed reliance upon the confessional statement of the appellant us 27 of the evidence act regarding recovery of the shawl which fact is spoken to by pw1 and he placed reliance upon the judgment in mritunjoy biswas v pranab alias kuti biswas and anr 2013 12 scc 796 2013 indlaw sc 490 and ramnaresh  ors v state of chhattisgarh 2012 4 scc 257 2012 indlaw sc 81 regarding non mentioning of the appellant in the fir does not vitiate the prosecution case the last seen theory of the deceased with the appellant support the finding and reasons recorded by the courts below in framing charges against the appellant by placing reliance upon the judgment in budhuram v state of chhattisgarh 2012 11 scc 588 2012 indlaw sc 312\n",
      "12 the learned counsel on behalf of the prosecution invited our attention to the evidence of the prosecution which is based on recording the evidence of pw12 and medical evidence of pw15 with regard to the age of the appellant his potency for intercourse which is established and further the oral evidence supported by the medical evidence particularly pw13 and pw15 justify the conviction and sentence awarded against the appellant on the charges levelled against the appellant therefore it is urged that the legal submissions urged on behalf of the appellant by placing reliance upon the judgments of this court which are referred to above do not support the case of the appellant therefore the learned counsel of the prosecution urged not to interfere with the concurrent finding of fact which is based on proper revaluation of legal evidence on record the same is supported by medical evidence though some evidence is circumstantial evidence the findings of the courts below are supported by cogent evidence on record hence the learned counsel requested for dismissal of the appeal by affirming the conviction and sentence awarded against the appellant\n",
      "13 with reference to the above rival contentions urged on behalf of the parties we have examined very carefully the entire evidence on record with a view to find out the correctness of the findings recorded on the charges levelled against the appellant\n",
      "14 three main points come up for the consideration in the present case\n",
      "whether the absence of name of the accused in the fir points towards the innocence of the accused and entitles him for acquittal whether the present case is a fit case to apply the last seen theory to establish the guilt of the accused\n",
      "whether the circumstantial evidence in the present case indicate towards the guilt of the accused and whether these evidences are sufficient to establish the guilt of the accused\n",
      "answer to point no 1\n",
      "15 we intend to address each contention separately and begin with the first contention of the appellant accused that his name did not appear for the first time in the fir and mention of his name was only an improvement of the first version it has been mentioned by the high court in the impugned judgment that the fir ex p1 initially did not mention the name of the accused and on the other hand pw1 father of the deceased child had suspected one of his relatives for the offence it was however revealed after investigation that it was the accused who committed the act and the police in fact was proceeding in the right path the involvement of the accused has been further corroborated by the recovery of the shawl of the deceased on the basis of the confession of the accused which was made in the presence of witnesses we intend to concur with the decision of the high court that non mentioning of the name in the initial fir is not fatal to the case of the prosecution it has been held by this court in the case of jitender kumar v state of haryana 2012 6 scc 204 2012 indlaw sc 579\n",
      "16 as already noticed the fir ext p2 had been registered by asi hans raj pw 13 on the statement of ishwar singh pw 11 it is correct that the name of accused jitender son of sajjan singh was not mentioned by pw 11 in the fir however the law is well settled that merely because an accused has not been named in the fir would not necessarily result in his acquittal an accused who has not been named in the fir but to whom a picdefinite role has been attributed in the commission of the crime and when such role is established by cogent and reliable evidence and the prosecution is also able to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt such an accused can be punished in accordance with law if found guilty every omission in the fir may not be so material so as to unexceptionally be fatal to the case of the prosecution various factors are required to be examined by the court including the physical and mental condition of the informant the normal behaviour of a man of reasonable prudence and possibility of an attempt on the part of the informant to falsely implicate an accused the court has to examine these aspects with caution further the court is required to examine such challenges in the light of the settled principles while keeping in mind as to whether the name of the accused was brought to light as an afterthought or on the very first possible opportunity\n",
      "17 the court shall also examine the role that has been attributed to an accused by the prosecution the informant might not have named a particular accused in the fir but such name might have been revealed at the earliest opportunity by some other witnesses and if the role of such an accused is established then the balance may not tilt in favour of the accused owing to such omission in the fir\n",
      "18 the court has also to consider the fact that the main purpose of the fir is to satisfy the police officer as to the commission of a cognizable offence for him to conduct further investigation in accordance with law the primary object is to set the criminal law into motion and it may not be possible to give every minute detail with unmistakable precision in the fir the fir itself is not the proof of a case but is a piece of evidence which could be used for corroborating the case of the prosecution the fir need not be an encyclopaedia of all the facts and circumstances on which the prosecution relies it only has to state the basic case the attending circumstances of each case would further have considerable bearing on application of such principles to a given situation reference in this regard can be made to state of up v krishna master 2010 indlaw sc 570 and ranjit singh v state of mp\n",
      "therefore the contention of the appellant that since his name did not appear in the fir he is entitled to acquittal is not maintainable we accordingly answer this point in favour of the respondent\n",
      "answer to point no 2\n",
      "16 it is the case of the prosecution that pw 3 the grandmother of the accused had sent the child to see whether the floor was grinded however when the child did not return for some time pw 3 went home at this juncture there is evidence through pw 5 and pw 12 who were employees under the accused that the accused took the child to the backyard while he unusually permitted pw 12 to go for lunch further the accused could not explain the need of taking an 8 year old child to the backyard in this aspect of the last seen theory it has been held by this court in the case of kusuma ankama rao v state of andhra pradesh 2008 13 scc 257 2008 indlaw sc 1126 as under\n",
      "10 so far as the lastseen aspect is concerned it is necessary to take note of two decisions of this court in state of up v satish 2005 indlaw sc 83 it was noted as follows\n",
      "22 the lastseen theory comes into play where the time gap between the point of time when the accused and the deceased were seen last alive and when the deceased is found dead is so small that possibility of any person other than the accused being the author of the crime becomes impossible it would be difficult in some cases to positively establish that the deceased was last seen with the accused when there is a long gap and possibility of other persons coming in between exists in the absence of any other positive evidence to conclude that the accused and the deceased were last seen together it would be hazardous to come to a conclusion of guilt in those cases in this case there is positive evidence that the deceased and the accused were seen together by witnesses pws 3 and 5 in addition to the evidence of pw 2\n",
      "emphasis laid by this court\n",
      "in ramreddy rajesh khanna reddy v state of ap 2006 indlaw sc 144 it was noted as follows\n",
      "27 the lastseen theory furthermore comes into play where the time gap between the point of time when the accused and the deceased were last seen alive and the deceased is found dead is so small that possibility of any person other than the accused being the author of the crime becomes impossible even in such a case the courts should look for some corroboration\n",
      "in the case in hand the deceased child was taken to the backyard of the mill by the accused and the same was seen by pw 5 and pw 12 the deceased child went missing since then and was found dead the next morning the accused did not explain why did he take the child to the backyard on the other hand he confessed to his crime which was corroborated by the recovery of a shawl at the instance of the accused himself in the presence of witnesses therefore in the light of the principle laid down by this court we are of the opinion that the high court was justified in holding the accused guilty of rape and murder of the deceased child we accordingly answer this point in favour of the respondent\n",
      "answer to point no 3\n",
      "17 on the date of occurrence at about 1000 pm the accused opened the mill unusually at odd hours the same was witnessed by pw 6 the textile shop owner whose shop was situated opposite the mill and also pw 7 who was the night watchman both had questioned the accused regarding this odd behaviour to which he answered that since the next day is ramzan he came for grinding the flour another strong circumstance was the evidence of pw 8 whose house is situated exactly behind the mill when pw 8 came out for attending the call of nature at 1015 pm he heard a noise from the well which is situated behind the mill and on seeing the accused proceeding towards the mill he stopped the accused and asked as to what he was doing to this the accused answered that the accused was throwing garbage in the well since the next day is ramzan since the dead body was found next day from the well circumstantial evidence points the involvement of the accused in throwing the dead body of the child in the well the previous night the high court therefore is justified in construing that the appellantaccused had kept the dead body in the mill and threw the dead body in the well at about 1015 pm\n",
      "18 it is true that in the present case there is no direct evidence which prove that the rape and murder of the deceased child was committed by the appellant there are no witnesses available on record who have testified having witnessed the appellant committing the crime however all the circumstances point towards the appellant as being the author of the crime in the present case it has been held by five judge bench of this court in the case of govinda reddy  anr v state of mysore air 1960 sc 29 1958 indlaw sc 214 as under\n",
      "5 the mode of evaluating circumstantial evidence has been stated by this court in hanumant govind nargundkar v state of madhya pradesh and it is as follows\n",
      "it is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is of a circumstantial nature the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should in the first instance be fully established and all the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused again the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency and they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved in other words there must be a chain of evidence so far complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and it must be such as to show that within all human probability the act must have been done by the accused\n",
      "19 again in the present case the recovery of the body of the deceased child from the same well where pw8 had seen the accused appellant the previous night throwing something in the well provides for a strong circumstantial evidence the unusual behaviour of the accused in taking the deceased child to the backyard of the mill sending of his employee for lunch at the same time and also the opening the mill in the odd hours of the night the very same evening points towards the guilt of the accused we answer this point in favour of the respondent\n",
      "20 since all the points are answered in favour of the respondent we hold that the high court was correct in upholding the decision of the sessions judge in convicting the accused of rape and murder of the deceased child\n",
      "we therefore sustain the decision of the high court and hold that the charges under sections 376 302 and 201 of ipc are proved against the appellant his sentence of life imprisonment and fine of rs5000 and in default one year rigorous imprisonment under section 376 life imprisonment and fine of rs5000 and on default one year rigorous imprisonment us 302 and also 3 years rigorous imprisonment and fine of rs1000 and on default rigorous imprisonment of six months us 201 of ipc is confirmed all sentences are to run concurrently accordingly the appeal is dismissed as the same is devoid of merit\n",

      "10  this court reversed the decision of the high court and restored the status of the excise appellate authority as a result of the ruling of this court the excise appellate authority by its order dated february 25 1957 directed delivery of possession back to the first appellant and his father holding that the order of resettlement and the resettlement itself in pursuance of that order were all wiped out against the said order the first respondent moved the high court under arts 226 and 227 of the constitution for quashing the order for delivery of possession on the ground of want of jurisdiction and for ad interim stay the high court issued a rule and passed an order for interim stay on february 26 1957 the high court made the rule absolute by its order dated march 26 1957 taking the view that the attention of this court had not been drawn to the interim settlement of the shop in the absence of an order of stay it appears further that during the pendency of the appeal in this court fresh settlement for the financial year 195758 took place towards the end of 1956 and the beginning of 1957 the tinsukia shop was settled with respondents i and 2 though the appellants also had jointly submitted a tender for the same the appellants and other parties preferred appeals against the said order of settlement made by the deputy commissioner the excise commissioner set aside the settlement by the deputy commissioner and directed settlement in favour of the appellants by his order dated april 16 1957 against that order respondents i and 2 and others preferred appeals before the excise appellate authority who by an order dated june 3 1957 dismissed the appeals accordingly the appellants were given possession of the shop on june 7 1957 the respondents i and 2 again moved the high court for quashing the order of the excise appellate authority affirming that of the excise commissioner and also prayed for the status quo being maintained the high court admitted the petition and ordered meanwhile status quo ante be maintained this took place on june 10 1957 in pursuance of the aforesaid order of the high court the appellants were dispossessed of the shop even though they had been put in possession only three days earlier this was done on a complete misapprehension of the true effect of the order of the high court maintaining status quo ante if the high court had passed its order in a less sophisticated and more easily understood language in that part of the country perhaps the party in possession would not have been dispossessed of the shop settled with it the appellants moved the high court against the commissioners order directing possession to be given to the respondents 1 and 2 the high court issued a rule but refused to grant stay of the operation of the order directing possession to be given during the final hearing of the rule before the high court the appellants again moved a petition on july 5 1957 for vacating the order of possession which was based on a misapprehension of the order of the high court maintaining status quo ante but apparently no order was passed because possession had already been given to the respondents i and 2 during the hearing of the rule by the high court an unfortunate incident occurred for which the appellants cannot altogether be absolved of some responsibility as a result of which one of the learned judges constituting the bench namely deka j expressed his unwillingness to proceed with the hearing of the case the hearing had therefore to be adjourned on july 15 1957 until a new bench could be constituted the appellants renewed their application already made on july 5 as aforesaid for undoing the unintended effect of the order of the high court that the status quo ante was to continue but on july 30 the chief justice directed that the matter be placed before a division bench as there was no third judge at the time the disposal of the case naturally had to stand over until the third judge was available the matter of delivery of possession was again mentioned before the division bench of the chief justice and deka j the high court rejected the application on grounds which cannot bear a close scrutinythe petitioners also approached the excise appellate authority but it refused to reconsider the matter as the case was then pending before the high court again on august 14 1957 a fresh application was made to the high court along with a copy of the orders passed by the excise appellate authority and the deputy commissioner lakhimpur giving delivery of possession to respondents 1 and 2 but this time deka j refused to hear the matter and naturally the chief justice directed the matter to be placed before him sitting singly on august 19 1957 the matter was placed before the chief justice sitting singly and he directed a rule to issue on the opposite party cited before that court to show cause apparently the learned chief justice treated the matter as a new case and not as an offshoot of the case already pending before the high court the high court closed for the long vacation on september 2 and was to reopen on november 3 1957 the vacancy of the third judge had not been filled till then and as the appellants felt that they had been wrongfully deprived of their right to hold their shop as a result of an erroneous interpretation of the order of the high court passed on june 10 as aforesaid and as there was no prospect of the case being disposed of quickly the appellants moved this court and obtained special leave to appeal\n",

      "12   rules 339 340 341 and 345 of the assam excise manual have thus become obsolete and have been deleted as a result of the latest amendment aforesaid the power of hearing appeals and revisions under the act has been vested successively in the board the assam revenue tribunal the commissioner for hills division and appeals and ultimately under the amended section in the appellate authority the history of the legislation relating to the highest revenue authority under the act has been traced in the judgment of this court in the state of assam van kidwai supra and need not be repeated here\n",
      "13   it is convenient first to deal with the general questions of public importance raised on behalf of the appellant in civil appeal no 670 of 1957 at the forefront of the arguments advanced on behalf of the appellate authority was the plea that the several authorities already indicated concerned with the settlement of excise shops like those in question in these appeals are merely administrative bodies and therefore their orders whether passed in the first instance or on appeal should not be amenable to the writ jurisdiction or supervisory jurisdiction of the high court under arts 226 and 227 of the constitution if the matter had rested only with the provisions of the act apart from the rules made under s 36 of the act much could have been said in support of this contention as observed by this court in the case of cooverjee b bharucha v the excise commissioner and the chief commissioner ajmer and others 1954 indlaw sc 159 880 there is no inherent right in a citizen to sell liquor it has further been observed by this court in the recent case of the state of assam v a n kidwai supra  at page 301 as follows\n",
      "a perusal of the act and rules will make it clear that do person has any absolute right to sell liquor and that the purpose of the act and the rules is to control and restrict the consumption of intoxicating liquors such control and restriction being obviously necessary for the preservation of public health and morals and to raise revenue\n",
      "14   it is true that no one has an inherent right to settlement of liquor shops but when the state by public notice invites candidates for settlement to make their tenders and in pursuance of such a notice a number of persons make such tenders each one makes a claim for himself in opposition to the claims of the others and the public authorities concerned with the settlement have to choose from amongst them if the choice had rested in the hands of only one authority like the district collector on his subjective satisfaction as to the fitness of a particular candidate without his orders being amenable to an appeal or appeals or revision the position may have been different but s 9 of the act has laid down a regular hierarchy of authorities one above the other with the right of hearing appeals or revisions though the act and the rules do not in express terms require reasoned orders to be recorded yet in the context of the subject matter of the rules it becomes necessary for the several authorities to pass what are called i speaking orders where there is a right vested in an authority created by statute be it administrative or quasijudicial to hear appeals and revisions it becomes its duty to hear judicially that is to say in an objective manner impartially and after giving reasonable opportunity to the parties concerned in the dispute to place their respective cases before it in this connection the observations of lord haldane at p 132 and of lord moulton at p 150 in local government board v arlidge  1915 ac 120  to the following effect are very apposite\n",
      "my lordswhen the duty of deciding an appeal is imposed those whose duty it is to decide it must act judicially they must deal with the question referred to them without bias and they must give to each of the parties the opportunity of adequately presenting the case made the decision must be come to in the spirit and with the sense of responsibility of a tribunal whose duty it is to mete out justice but it does not follow that the procedure of every such tribunal must be the same\n",
      "15  lord moulton\n",
      "in the present case however the legislature has provided an appeal but it is an appeal to an administrative department of state and not to a judicial body it is said truthfully that on such an appeal the local government board must act judicially but this in my opinion only means that it must preserve a judicial temper and perform its duties conscientiously with a proper feeling of responsibility in view of the fact that its acts affect the property and rights of individuals parliament has wisely laid down certain rules to be observed in the performance of its functions in these matters and those rules must be observed because they are imposed by statute and for no other reason and whether they give much or little opportunity for what i may call quasilitigious procedure depends solely on what parliament has thought right these rules are beyond the criticism of the courts and it is not their business to add to or take away from them or even to discuss whether in the opinion of the individual members of the court they are adequate or not\n",
      "16   the legal position has been very succinctly put in halsburys laws of england as follows\n",
      "moreover an administrative body whose decision is actuated in whole or in part by questions of policy may be under a duty to act judicially in the course of arriving at that decision thus if in order to arrive at the decision the body concerned had to consider proposals and objections and consider evidence if at some stage of the proceedings leading up to the decision there was something in the nature of a lis before it then in the course of such consideration and at that stage the body would be under a duty to act judicially if on the other hand an administrative body in arriving at its decision has before it at no stage any form of lis and throughout has to consider the question from the point of view of policy and expediency it cannot be said that it is under a duty at any time to act judicially even where the body is at some stage of the proceedings leading up to the decision under a duty to act judicially the supervisory jurisdiction of the court does not extend to considering the sufficiency of the grounds for or otherwise challenging the decision itself\n",
      "17   the provisions of the act are intended to safeguard the interest of the state on the one band by stopping or at any rate checking illicit distillation and on the other band by raising the maximum revenue consistently with the observance of the rules of temperance the authorities under the act with subdivisional officers at the bottom and the appellate authority at the apex of the hierarchy are charged with those duties the rules under the act and the executive instructions which have no statutory force but which are meant for the guidance of the officers concerned enjoin upon those officers the duty of seeing to it that shops are settled with persons of character and experience in the line subject to certain reservations in favour of tribal population except those general considerations there are no specific rules governing the grant of leases or licences in respect of liquor shops and in a certain contingency even drawing of lots is provided for vide executive instructions 110 at p 174 of the manual the words of subs 3 of s 9 as amended set out above vest complete discretion in the appellate authority the excise commissioner or the district collector to pass such orders thereon as it or he may think fit the sections of the act do not make any reference to the recording of evidence or hearing of parties or even recording reasons for orders passed by the authorities aforesaid\n",
      "18   but we have been informed at the bar that as a matter of practice the authorities under the act hear counsel for the parties and give reasoned judgments so as to enable the higher authorities to know why a particular choice has been made that is also apparent from the several orders passed by them in course of these few cases that are before us but when we come to the rules relating to appeals and revisions we find that the widest scope for going up in appeal or revision has been given to persons interested because r 344 only lays down that no appeal shall lie against the orders of composition thus leaving all other kinds of orders open to appeal or revision rule 343 provides that every memorandum of appeal shall be presented within one month from the date of the order appealed against subject to the requisite time for obtaining a certified copy of the order being excluded rule 344 requires the memorandum of appeal to be accompanied by a certified copy of the order appealed against the memorandum of appeal has to be stamped with a requisite courtfee stamp rule 343 was further amended by the notification dated march 14 1957 by adding the following proviso and explanations to that rule\n",
      "provided further that the competent appellate authority shall have the power to admit the appeal after the prescribed period of limitation when the appellant satisfies the appellate authority that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appealwithin such period\n",
      "explanation 1 the fact that the appellant was misled by any order practice or judgment of any appellate authority in ascertaining or computing the prescribed period of limitation may be sufficient cause within the meaning of this rule\n",
      "explanation 2 the fact that the appellate authority was unable to function for any period by reason of any judicial pronouncement shall be sufficient cause within the meaning of this rule\n",
      "the amendment shall be deemed to have been made on 23rd may 1956 and shall have retrospective effect since that date\n",
      "19   these rules read along with the recent amendments set out above approximate the procedure to be followed by the appellate authorities to the regular procedure observed by courts of justice in entertaining appeals as would appear from the ruling of this court at p 304 where the provisions and effect of the assam revenue tribunal  act 1948 assam iv of 1948 have been set out the ultimate jurisdiction to hear appeals and revisions was divided between the assam high court and the authority referred to in s 33 of that act appeals and revisions arising out of cases covered by the provisions of the enactments specified in schedule a to that act were to lie in and to be heard by the assam high court and the jurisdiction to entertain appeals and revisions in matters arising under the provisions of the enactments specified in schedule b to that act was vested in the authority to be set up under s 33 that is to say for the purposes of the present appeals before us the excise appellate authority thus the excise appellate authority for the purposes of cases arising under the act was vested with the power of the highest appellate tribunal even as the high court was in respect of the other group of cases that does not necessarily mean that the excise appellate authority was a tribunal of coordinate jurisdiction with the high court or that that authority was not amenable to the supervisory jurisdiction of the high court under arts 226 and 227 of the constitution but the juxtaposition of the two parallel highest tribunals one in respect of predominantly civil cases and the other in respect of predominantly revenue cases  would show that the excise appellate authority was not altogether an administrative body which had no judicial or quasijudicial functions\n",
      "20   neither the act nor the rules made thereunder indicate the grounds on which the first appellate authority namely the excise commissioner or the second appellate authority  has to exercise his or its appellate or revisional powers there is no indication that they make any distinction between the grounds of interference on appeal and in revision that being so the powers of the appellate authorities in the matter of settlement would be coextensive with the powers of the primary authority namely the district collector or the sub divisional officer see in this connection the observations of the federal court in lachmeshwar prasad shukul and others v keshwar lal chaudhuri and others  1940 fcr 84 102 and of this court in ebrahim aboobakar and another v custodian general of evacuee property 1952 indlaw sc 8 704 in the latter case this court dealing with the powers of the tribunal  under s 24 of ordinance no 27 of 1949 observed\n",
      "like all courts of appeal exercising general jurisdiction in civil cases the respondent has been constituted an appellate court in words of the widest amplitude and the legislature has not limited his jurisdiction by providing that such exercise will depend on the existence of any particular state of facts\n",
      "21   thus on a review of the provisions of the act and the rules framed thereunder it cannot be said that the authorities mentioned in s 9 of the act pass purely administrative orders which are beyond the ambit of the high courts power of supervision and control whether or not an administrative body or authority functions as a purely administrative one or in a quasijudicial capacity must be determined in each case on an examination of the relevant statute and the rule   framed thereunder the first contention raised on behalf of the appellant must therefore be overruled\n",
      "22   now turning to the merits of the high courts order it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the high court had misdirected itself in holding that the appellate authority had exceeded its jurisdiction in passing the order it did there is no doubt that if the appellate authority whose duty it is to determine questions affecting the right to settlement of a liquor shop in a judicial or quasijudicial manner acts in excess of its authority vested by law that is to say the act and the rules thereunder its order is subject to the controlling authority of the high court the question therefore is whether the high court was right in holding that the appellate authority had exceeded its legal power in this connection it is best to reproduce in the words of the high court itself what it conceived to be the limits of the appellate jurisdiction\n",
      "in other words it is not for the appellate authority to make the choice since the choice has already been made by the officers below and it is not only where the choice is perverse or illegal and not in accordance with the rules that the appellate authority can interfere with the order and make its own selected  out of the persons offering tenders if the appellate bodies chose to act differently and consider themselves free to make their own choice of the person to be offered settlement irrespective of the recommendations of the deputy commissioner or the officer conducting the settlement the appellate bodies will be obviously exceeding the jurisdiction which they possess under the law or going beyond the scope of their authority as contemplated by the rules\n",
      "23   in our opinion in so circumscribing the powers of the appellate authority the high court has erred see in this connection the decision of this court in raman and raman ltd v the state of madras 1956 indlaw sc 77  in that case this court dealt with the powers of the state government which had been vested with the final authority in the matter of grant of stage carriage permits this court held that as the state government had been constituted the final authority under the motor vehicles act to decide as between the rival claimants for permits its decision could not be interfered with under art 226 of the constitution merely because the governments view may have been erroneous in the instant cases the appellate authority is contemplated by s 9 of the act to be the highest authority for deciding questions of settlement of liquor shops as between rival claimants the appeal or revision being undefined and unlimited in its scope the highest authority under the act could not be deprived of the plenitude of its powers by introducing considerations which are not within the act or the rules\n",
      "24   it is true that the appellate authority should not lightly set aside the selection made by the primary authority that is to say a selection made by a subdivisions officer or by a district collector should be given due weight in view of the fact that they have much greater opportunity to know local conditions and local business people than the appellate authority even as the appeal courts are enjoined not to interfere lightly with findings of fact recorded by the original courts which had the opportunity of seeing witnesses depose in court and their demeanour while deposing in court but it is not correct to hold that because the appellate authority in the opinion of the high court has not observed that caution the choice made by it is in excess of its power or without jurisdiction\n",
      "25   the next ground of attack against the order of the high court under appeal was that the high court had erred in coming to the conclusion that there had been a failure of natural justice in this connection the high court has made reference to the several affidavits filed on either side and the order in which they had been filed and the use made of those affidavits or counteraffidavits as already indicated the rules make no provisions for the reception of evidence oral or documentary or the hearing of oral arguments or even for the issue of notice of the hearing to the parties concerned the entire proceedings are marked by a complete lack of formality the several authorities have been left to their own resources to make the best selection in this connection reference may be made to the observations of this court in the case of new prakash transport co ltd v new suwarna transport co ltd 1 in that case this court has laid down that the rules of natural justice vary with the varying constitutions of statutory bodies and the rules prescribed by the act under which they function  and the question whether or not any rules of natural justice had been contravened should be decided not under any preconceived notions but in the light of the statutory rules and provisions in the instant case no such rules have been brought to our notice which could be said to have been contravened by the appellate authority simply because it viewed a case in a particular light which may not be acceptable to another independent tribunal is no ground for interference either under art 226 or art 227 of the constitution\n",
      "26   it remains to consider the last contention raised on behalf of the appellants in these cases namely whether there has been any error apparent on the face of the record in the order of the appellate authority which would attract the supervisory jurisdiction of the high court in this connection the following observations of the high court are relevant\n",
      "27\n",
      "but the most glaring error on face of the order of the appellate authority is that it does not even refer to the report of the deputy commissioner on which the excise commissioner had so strongly relied in my opinion it was under the rules obligatory on the appellate authority to consider that report before disposing of the appeal and in failing to do so the officer acted arbitrarily and in excess of his powers as an appellate authority\n",
      "28   it may be that durinly the prolonged hearing of these cases before the high court where counsel for the different parties placed their respective view points after making copious references to the documents the high court was greatly impressed that the order of settlement in one case murmuria shop made by the deputy commissioner as confirmed by the excise commissioner was the right one and that the choice made by the appellate authority did not commend itself to the high court it may further be that the conclusions of fact of the high court were more in consonance with the entire record of the proceedings and that the choice made by the ultimate revenue authority was wrong but under the law as it stands the high court exceeded its powers in pronouncing upon the merits of a controversy which the legislature has left to the discretion of the appellate authority but is that a mistake apparent on the face of the record as understood in the context of art 226 of the constitution\n",
      "29   that leads us to a consideration of the nature of the error which can be said to be an error apparent on the face of the record which would be one of the grounds to attract the supervisory jurisdiction of the high court under art 226 of the constitution the ancient writ of certiorari which now in england is known as the order of certiorari could be issued on very limited grounds these grounds have been discussed by this court in the cases of parry  co v commercial employees association madras  1952 indlaw sc 601 veerappa pillai v raman and raman ltd  and others  1952 indlaw sc 45  ibrahim aboobaker v custodian general of evacuee property  1952 indlaw sc 8 3 t c basappa v t nagappa\n",
      "30   all these cases have been considered by this court in the case of hari vishnu kamath v syed ahmad ishaque and others  1954 indlaw sc 212 1121 venkatarama ayyar j speaking for the full court laid down four propositions bearing on the character and scope of the writ of certiorari as established upon the authorities the third proposition out of those four may be stated in the words of that learned judge as follows\n",
      "the court issuing a writ of certiorari acts in exercise of a supervisory and not appellate jurisdiction one consequence of this is that the court will not review findings of fact reached by the inferior court or tribunal even if they be erroneous\n",
      "31   while considering the fourth proposition whether the writ can be issued in the case of a decision which was erroneous in law after considering the recent authorities the same learned judge in the course of his judgment at p 1123 has observed as follows\n",
      "it may therefore be taken as settled that a writ of certiorari could be issued to correct an error of law but it is essential that it should be something more than a mere error it must be one which must be manifest on the face of the record\n",
      "32   the high court appears to have been under the impression that the expression error apparent on the face of the record may also be in respect of findings of fact for example in civil appeal no 668 of 1957 relating to jorhat shop the high court has observed as follows\n",
      "the appellate authority further reinforced its suspicion by mentioning that dharmeswar his father and brother are summoned in connection with some complaint but that was a matter purely extraneous  to speak the least and it could have found that the complaint was filed after the settlement the complaint had no reference to any offence of smuggling or the like as has been conceded these were errors ap parent on the face of the record\n",
      "33   later in the course of the same judgment it has been observed as follows\n",
      "this is another instance where i find that the excise appellate authority has misconceived its powers as such and purported to decide the appeal either on errors of record speculations or on irrelevant considerations irrespective of all that happened in the earlier stages of the matter it starts with an apparent error of record when it says that in the judgment of the excise commissioner it finds a clear admission that shri garela kalita father of shri dharmeswar kalita is a suspected smuggler in fact there was no such admission it was held by the commissioner on the contrary that the learned deputy commissioner and members of the advisory committee thought that the major son who bears an excellent character should not be punished for the alleged sin of his father\n",
      "34   these excerpts from the judgment of the high court are not exhaustive but only illustrative of the observation that the high court appears to have treated an error of fact on the same footing as an error of law apparent on the face of the record the question naturally arises whether an error of fact can be invoked in aid of the power of the high court to quash an order of a subordinate court or tribunal the high court would appear to have approximated it to an error apparent on the face of the record as used in r 1 of 0 47 of the civil procedure code as one of the grounds for review of a judgment or order but that is clearly not the correct position ordinarily a mistake of law in a judgment or an order of a court would not be a ground for review it is a mistake or an error of fact apparent on the face of the record which may attract the power of review as contemplated by r i of 0 47 but is the power of a high court under art 226 of the constitution to interfere on certiorari attracted by such a mistake and not the reverse of it in the sense that it is only an error of law apparent on the face of the record which can attract the supervisory jurisdiction of a high court\n",
      "35   this question so far as we know has not been raised in this form in this court in any one of the previous decisions bearing on the scope and character of the writ of certiorari it is therefore necessary to examine this question directly raised in this batch of appeals because in each case the high court has been invited to exercise its powers under art 226 to issue a writ of certiorari on the specific ground that the orders impugned before it had been vitiated by errors apparent on the face of the record errors not of law but of fact\n",
      "36   the ancient case of the queen v james bolton is treated as a landmark on the question of the power to issue a writ or order of certiorari that was a case in which an order of justices for delivering up a house to parish officers under a statute was called up on certiorari lord denman c j while discharging the rule made the following observations in the course of his judgment which have been treated as authoritative and good law even now\n",
      "the first of these is a point of much importance because of very general application  but the principle upon which it turns is very simple the difficulty is always found in applying it the case to be supposed is one like the present in which the legislature has trusted the original it may be as here the final jurisdiction on the merits to the magistrates below in which this court has no jurisdiction as to the merits either originally or on appeal all that we can then do when their decision is complained of is to see that the case was one within their jurisdiction and that their proceedings on the face of them are regular and according to law even if their decision should upon the merits be unwise or unjust on these grounds we cannot reverse it\n",
      "37   while dealing with the argument at the bar complaining of the unsoundness of the conclusions reached by the magistrates and the hardships to be caused by their erroneous order the court made the following observations which are very apposite to the facts and circumstances disclosed in the instant appeals and which all courts entrusted with the duty of administering law should bear in mind so that they may not be deflected from the straight path of enforcing the law by considerations based on hardship or on vague 1057 1058 ideas of what is sometimes described as justice of the cause\n",
      "beyond this we cannot go the affidavits being before us were used od the argument and much was said of the unreasonableness of the conclusion drawn by the magistrates and of the hardship on the defendant if we would not review it there being no appeal to the sessions we forbear to express any opinion on that which is not before us the propriety of the conclusion drawn from the evidence by the magistrates they and they alone were the competent authority to draw it and we must not constitute ourselves into a court of appeal where the statute does not make us such because it has constituted no otherit is of much more importance to hold the rule of law straight than from a feeling of the supposed hardship of any particular decision to interpose relief at the expense of introducing a precedent full of inconvenience and uncertainty in the decision of future cases\n",
      "38   the case of reg v bolton supra was approved and followed by the privy council in the case of the king v nat b 11 liqutors limited  1922 2 ac 128  in that case their lordships of the judicial committee held that a conviction by a magistrate for a nonindictable offence cannot be quashed on certiorari on the ground that the record showed that there was no evidence to support the conviction or that the magistrate had misdirected himself in considering the evidence it was further laid down that the absence of evidence did not affect the jurisdiction of the magistrate to try the charge in the course of their judgment their lord ships further observed that the law laid down in reg v bolton supra has never been seriously questioned in england and that the same rules were applicable to other parts of the commonwealth except in so far as they may have been modified by statute they also observed that the decision in reg v bolton supra undoubtedly is a landmark in the history of certiorari for it summarises in an impeccable form the principles of its application but latterly the rule laid down in boltons case appears to have been slurred over in some decided cases in england which purported to lay down that a writ or order of certiorari could be obtained only if the order impugned disclosed an error of jurisdiction that is to say complete lack of jurisdiction or excess of jurisdiction or the refusal to exercise jurisdiction and not to correct an error of law even though apparent on the face of the record\n",
      "39  the question was brought to a head in the case of rex v northumberland compensation appeal tribunal 1 it arose out of an application for an order of certiorari for quashing a decision reached by the respondent northumberland compensation appeal tribunal lord goddard c j began his judgment by observing that the point involved in the case was of the very greatest importance which had necessitated the examination of a large number of cases and consideration of the principles which apply to the doctrine of certiorari he further observed that certiorari is a remedy of a very special character he then discussed the object and scope of the writ of certiorari and the history of the jurisdiction as exercised in the english courts he then dealt with the contention directly raised for the determination of the court that an order of certiorari can issue only to remove a defect of jurisdiction and that it does not extend to removing an order out of the way of the parties on account of a mistake of law apparent on the face of the record the court then considered the relevant authorities and came to the conclusion that it was wrong to hold that the ground of interference on certiorari was only an error or excess of jurisdiction and that it did not extend to correction of an error of law apparent on the face of the record the lord chief justice then pointed out that the examination of the authorities bearing on the exercise of the power of certiorari yielded the result that it was open to the high court to examine the record and to see whether or not there was an error of law apparent on the face of the record the lord chief justice concluded his observations with these remarks\n",
      "the tribunal have told us what they have taken into account what they have disregarded and the contentions which they accepted they have told us their view of the law and we are of opinion that the construction which they placed on this very complicated set of regulations was wrong\n",
      "40   this decision was challenged and on appeal the court of appeal dealt with this point in rex v northumberland compensation appeal tribunal 1952 1 kb 338  the court of appeal affirmed the proposition laid down by the high court that an order for certiorari can be granted and the decision of an inferior court such as a statutory tribunal quashed on the ground of an error of law apparent on the face of the record singleton l j in the course of his judgment observed that an error on the face of the proceedings which in that case was an error of law has always been re cognized as one of the grounds for the issue of an order of certiorari denning l j also in the course of his judgment examined the question whether the high court could intervene to correct the decision of a statutory tribunal which is erroneous in point of law on an examination of the authorities from ancient times the lord justice made the following observations\n",
      "of recent years the scope of certiorari seems to have been somewhat forgotten it has been supposed to be confined to the correction of excess of jurisdiction and not to extend to the correction of errors of law  and several judges have said as much but the lord chief justice has in the present case restored certiorari to its rightful position and shown that it can be used to correct errors of law which appear on the face of the record even though they do not go to jurisdiction i have looked into the history of the matter and find that the old cases fully support all that the lord chief justice said until about 100 years ago certiorari was regularly used to correct errors of law on the face of the record it is only within the last century that it has fallen into disuse and that is only because there has until recently been little occasion for its exercise now with the advent of many new tribunals and the plain need for supervision over them recourse must once again be had to this well tried means of control\n",
      "35 the other lord justice who took part in the hearing of the appeal morris l j also examined that question and concluded as follows\n",
      "it is plain that certiorari will not issue as the cloak of an appeal in disguise it does not lie in order to bring up an order or decision for rehearing of the issue raised in the proceedings it exists to correct error of law where revealed on the face of an order or decision or irregularity or absence of or excess of jurisdiction where shown\n",
      "36 it is clear from an examination of the authorities of this court as also of the courts in england that one of the grounds on which the jurisdiction of the high court on certiorari may be invoked is an error of law apparent on the face of the record and not every error either of law or fact which can be corrected by a superior court in exercise of its statutory powers as a court of appeal or revision\n",
      "37 so far as we know it has never been contended be fore this court that an error of fact even though apparent on the face of the record could be a ground for interference by the court exercising its writ jurisdiction no ruling was brought to our notice in support  of the proposition that the court exercising its powers under art 226 of the constitution could quash an order of an inferior tribunal on the ground of a mistake of fact apparent on the face of the record\n",
      "38 but the question still remains as to what is the legal import of the expression error of law apparent on the face of the record is it every error of law that can attract the supervisory jurisdiction of the high court to quash the order impugned  this court as observed above has settled the law in this respect by laying down that in order to attract such jurisdiction it is essential that the error should be something more than a mere error of law that it must be one which is manifest on the face of the record in this respect the law in india and the law in england are therefore the same it is also clear on an examination of all the authorities of this court and of those in england referred to above as also those considered in the several judgments of this court that the common law writ now called order of certiorari which was also adopted by our constitution is not meant to take the place of an appeal where the statute does not confer a right of appeal its purpose is only to determine on an examination of the record whether the inferior tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction or has not proceeded in accordance with the essential requirements of the law which it was meant to administer  mere formal or technical errors even though of law will not be sufficient to attract this extraordinary jurisdiction\n",
      "39 the principle underlying the jurisdiction to issue a writ or order of certiorari is no more in doubt but the real difficulty arises as it often does in applying the principle to the particular facts of a given case in the judgments and orders impugned in these appeals the high court has exercised its supervisory jurisdic note in respect of errors which cannot be said to be errors of law apparent on the face of the record if at all they are errors they are errors in appreciation of documentary evidence or affidavits errors in drawing inferences or omission to draw inferences in other words those are errors which a court sitting as a court of appeal only could have examined and if necessary corrected as already indicated the appellate authority had unlimited jurisdiction to examine and appreciate the evidence in the exercise of its appellate or revisional jurisdiction s 93 of the act gives it the power to pass such orders as it thought fit these are words of very great amplitude the jurisdiction of the appellate authority to entertain the appeals has never been in doubt or dispute only the manner of the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction was in controversy it has not been shown that in exercising its powers the appellate authority disregarded any mandatory provisions of the law the utmost that has been suggested is that it has not carried out certain executive instructions for example it has been said that the appellate authority did not observe theb instructions that tribal people have to be given certain preferences or that persons on the debarred list like  smugglers should be kept out  but all these are only executive instructions which have no statutory force\n",
      "40 hence even assuming though it is by no means clear that those instructions have been disregarded the nonobservance of those instructions cannot affect the power of the appellate authority to make its own selection or affect the validity of the order passed by it\n",
      "40 the high court in its several judgments and orders has scrutinized in great detail the orders passed by the excise authorities under the act we have not thought it fit to examine the record or the orders below in any detail because in our opinion it is not the function of the high court or of this court to do so the jurisdiction under art 226 of the constitution is limited to seeing that the judicial or quasijudicial tribunals or administrative bodies exercising quasi judicial powers do not exercise their powers in excess of their statutory jurisdiction but correctly administer the law within the ambit of the statute creating them or entrusting those functions to them the act has created its own hierarchy of officers and appellate authorities as indicated above to administer the law so long as those authorities function within the letter and spirit of the law the high court has no concern with the manner in which those powers have been exercised in the instant cases the high court appears to have gone beyond the limits of its powers under arts 226 and 227 of the constitution\n",
      "41 in one of the cases the high court has observed that though it could have interfered by issuing a writ under art 226 of the constitution they would be content to utilize their powers of judicial superintendence under art 227 of the constitution vide its judgment dated july 31 1957 in appeals relating to murmuria shop civil appeals nos 669 and 670 of 1957 in exercise of that power the high court set aside the order of the appellate authority and directed it to rehear the appeal according to law in the light of the principles indicated in this judgment\n",
      "42 a constitution bench of this court examined the scope of art 227 of the constitution in the case of waryam singh and another v amarnath and another  1954 indlaw sc 180  this court in the course of its judgment made the following observations at p 571\n",
      "this power of superintendence conferred by art 227 is as pointed out by harries c j in dalmia jain airways ltd v sukumar mukherjee  to be exercised most sparingly and only in appropriate cases in order to keep the subordinate courts within the bounds of their authority and not for correcting mere errors\n",
      "43 it is thus clear that the powers of judicial interference under art 227 of the constitution with orders of judicial or quasijudicial nature are not greater than the powers under art 226 of the constitution under art 226 the power of interference may extend to quashing an impugned order on the ground of a mistake apparent on the face of the record but under art 227 of the constitution the power of interference is limited to seeing that the tribunal functions within the limits of its authority hence interference by the high court in these cases either under art 226 or 227 of the constitution was not justified\n",
      "44 after having dealt with the common arguments more or less applicable to all the cases it remains to consider the special points raised on behalf of the respondents in civil appeal no 672 of 1957 relating to the tinsukia country spirit shop it was strenuously argued that the appeal was incompetent in view of the fact that the rule issued by the high court was still pending and that this court does not ordinarily entertain an appeal against an interlocutory order it is true that this court does not interfere in cases which have not been decided by the high court but this case has some extraordinary features which attracted the notice of this court when special leave to appeal was granted as already stated the shop in question was settled with the appellants by the excise commissioner and his order was upheld by the appellate authority\n",
      "41 accordingly the appellants had been put in possession of the shop on june 7 1957 the high court while issuing the rule passed an order on the stay application which as already indicated had been misunderstood by the district excise authorities and the appellants were dispossessed and the respondents i and 2 put back in possession without any authority of law this was a flagrant interference with the appellants rights arising out of the settlement made in their favour by the highest revenue authorities the high court had not and could not have authorized the dispossession of the persons rightfully in possession of the shop the appellants brought this flagrant abuse of power to the notice of the high court several times but the high court felt unduly constrained to permit the wrong to continue we heard the learned counsel for the respondents at great length as to whether he could justify the continuance of this undesirable and unfortunate state of affairs it has to be remembered that the appellants as a result of fortuitous circumstances had been deprived of the possession of the shop during the best part of the financial year 195657 the appellants had been deprived of the fruits of their hardwon victory in the revenue courts without any authority of law and the high court failed to right the wrong in time though moved several times in these circumstances we found it necessary to hear both the parties on the merits of the orders passed by the commissioner of excise and the appellate authority in favour of the appellants against which the respondents had obtained a rule\n",
      "42 after having heard both sides we have come to the conclusion that no grounds have been made out for interference by the high court under its powers under arts 226 and 227 of the constitution this case shares the common fate of the other cases before us of having run through the entire gamut of the hierarchy created under the act read along with the amending act and the rules thereunder we do not find any grounds in the orders of the excise authorities which could attract the supervisory jurisdiction of the high court there being no error of law apparent on the face of the record or a defect of jurisdiction in the authorities whose orders have been impugned in the high court we would however like to make it clear that we are interfering with the interlocutory order passed by the high court in this case because of its unusual and exceptional features it is clear that our decision on the main points urged in the other appeals necessarily leads to the inference that even if all the allegations made by the respondents in their petition before the assam high court are accepted as true there would be no case whatever for issuing a rule indeed the respondent found it difficult to resist the appellants argument that if the other appeals were allowed on the general contentions raised by the appellants the dismissal of his petition before the assam high court would be a foregone conclusion it is because of these special circumstances that we have decided to interfere with the interlocutory order in this case in the interests of justice\n",
      "45 as a result of these considerations the appeals must be allowed and the orders passed by the high court in the several cases set aside on the question of costs we direct that the appellants in each case should get their costs here and in the high court except the appellant in civil appeal no 670 who has failed on the main point raised on his behalf and who therefore must bear his own costs\n",

    "#In short, the case involves an individual who was appointed as an Officer in a bank and was also involved in a society formed to construct residential premises for bank employees. There were allegations of misappropriation of funds in the society, leading to inquiries and criminal charges against the individual. The bank suspended the individual, terminated his services, and later refused to reinstate him even after he was acquitted of the criminal charges. The individual filed a writ petition in the High Court, seeking to quash the bank's orders. Initially, the Single Judge granted relief, but the Division Bench of the High Court disagreed and dismissed the petition, citing delays and considering the merits of the case. This led to an appeal to the higher court.\n",
    "#The appellant on February 9, 1961 was appointed as an Officer in Grade III in the respondent Bank ( for short 'the Bank'). He was promoted on April 1, 1968 to the Grade officer in the Foreign Exchange Department in the Head Office of the Bank. Sometime in 1964, MCH Society ( for short 'the Society') was formed of which the appellant was one of the chief promoters and thereafter its Secretary. The object of the Society was to construct residential premises for the employees of the Bank and its other members. It appears that the complaint was received in respect of the affairs of the Society relating to misappropriation of the funds of the Society and consequently, in exercise of the powers under Section S of Act A1, the Registrar on April 23, 1969 instituted an inquiry thereof. P1 was appointed the Registrar's nominee who on October 4, 1969; submitted the report holding the appellant and two other office bearers of the Society negligent in dealing with the funds of the Society causing a loss to the tune of Rs. 3,59,000/-. The Registrar on October 21, 1969, passed an order appointing an officer under Section S of A1 to assess the loss caused to the Society. However, the Government by its order dated November 29, 1969 annulled the Registrar's order dated April 23, 1969 and October 21, 1969 and directed a fresh inquiry into the affairs of the Society. On December 17, 1969, the Bank issued show cause notice to the appellant to explain within fifteen days his alleged negligent conduct in dealing with the affairs of the Society as revealed in the report dated 4th October, 1969. In the meantime, P2 came to be appointed by the Registrar vide his order dated 26th July, 1969, to make inquiries under Section S of A1. Petitioner by his reply dated 18/22th January, 1970 submitted his explanation and also challenged the legality of the inquiry and the findings recorded therein. On 5th March, 1970, P3, treasurer of the Society and an employee of the Bank criminal complaints in the Court of Addl. Chief Presidency Magistrate  alleging that the appellant and two other office bearers of the society had dishonestly misappropriated a sum of Rs. 51,000/ and Rs. 80,000/- respectively which was entrusted to the appellant in his capacity as Promoter and Secretary of the Society and thereby committed criminal breach of trust. The Magistrate framed the charges against the appellant. The Bank having regard to the serious misconduct of the appellant involving moral turpitude vide its order dated 3rd November, 1970 suspended the appellant pending trial. The appellant protested this action of the Bank complaining that he was not given an opportunity of hearing before passing the order of suspension. In the meantime, P2, the authorized officer appointed by the Registrar vide his order dated 9th October, 1971 held the appellant liable to pay Rs. 2,36,000/- to the Society in addition to the amount of Rs. 2,03,000/- for which he (the appellant) and two other office bearers of the Society were held jointly liable. The Bank in view of this finding, vide its order dated 29th November, 1971 terminated the services of the appellant with effect from 1st December, 1971 along with notice pay. The appellant protested against the Action of the Bank and on 3rd December, 1971 filed detailed representation against the order of termination. The Bank replied to the appellant's representation and justified its action. The appellant on 28th December, 1971 submitted his reply to the Bank stating, inter alia, that the termination of his services was not simplicitor and was in violation of the principles of natural justice; that no opportunity of hearing was given to him; that the termination order attached stigma. The appellant aggrieved by the findings and order made by P2 appealed before Tribunal. In the meantime, the criminal proceedings ended in conviction vide order dated 27th March, 1972 passed by the Addl. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate. The appellant challenged the order of conviction and sentence in the High Court  and during the pendency of the said appeal, the Tribunal vide its order dated April 12, 1973 dismissed the appellant's appeal but reduced the liability by Rs. 72,000/-. On November 12, 1973, the High Court allowed the criminal appeal and acquitted the appellant. The High Court, however, in its order observed that since the services of the appellant were terminated in view of the criminal proceedings and since the appellant has been acquitted, representation, if a any, by the appellant to the Bank for reinstatement may be considered sympathetically. Taking clue from the observations made by the High Court, the appellant filed three representations, the last being dated 3rd May, 1975 requesting the Bank to revoke the order of termination and be reinstated. The Bank vide its communication dated May 21, 1975 refused to reinstate the appellant. The appellant, therefore, on July 23, 1975 filed the writ petition in the High Court for quashing the orders dated 29th November 1971, 27th December, 1971 and 21st May, 1975 passed by the Bank. The learned Single Judge of the High Court by his judgment and order dated December 6/7, 1979 granted desired relief to the appellant. The Bank aggrieved by the judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge preferred an appeal under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent. The appeal was heard by the Division Bench. The Division Bench of the High Court did not agree with the judgment passed by the learned Single Judge and consequently by its judgment and order dated April 16 1985 allowed the appeal and dismissed the writ petition the ground of laches and also on merits. It is this judgment and order of the High Court which is impugned in this appeal.\n",

      "3 the appellant was recruited as a civil judge junior division and judicial magistrate in 1981 in the judicial service of the state of gujarat he was promoted as a civil judge senior division in 1996 the charges which emanated against him from a chargesheet dated 31 august 2001 related to his work as a judicial officer when he was posted as chief judicial magistrate at bhuj from 6 may 1996 to 15 june 1998 two criminal cases involving offences punishable under section 135 of the customs act 1962 and the imports  exports control act 1947 were tried by him\n",
      "4 in criminal case 1293 of 1995 the appellant delivered a judgment on 22 january 1997 convicting the accused but awarded a sentence of imprisonment less than the minimum prescribed by section 135 moreover the sentence of imprisonment was so structured that after allowing the benefit of a setoff the accused was not required to remain in jail for a further period in the second criminal case criminal case 675 of 1994 the trial involved offences inter alia under section 135 of the customs act 1962 fourteen accused were alleged to be involved in the smuggling of 275 silver slabs of a value of rs 58650620 the trial of two of the accused who are absconding was separated from the rest by a judgment dated 11 march 1997 the appellant held the twelve accused who were brought to trial to be guilty of the charges however save and except for five of the accused persons the appellant awarded less than the minimum punishment prescribed under section 135 all the accused were granted a setoff details of the sentences awarded are contained in the following table\n",
      "5 this formed the subject matter of departmental inquiry 15 of 2000 in which a chargesheet was issued on 31 august 2001 it was alleged that the appellant who was a senior judicial officer was aware of the provisions of section 135 which prescribe the award of at least a minimum sentence the case involved smuggling of a huge quantity of contraband articles the appellant it was alleged was aware of judicial decisions mandating that a liberal view should not be taken in the award of sentences in such cases yet with the intention of favouring the accused the appellant was alleged to have awarded less than the minimum sentence without recording special or adequate reasons moreover it was alleged that\n",
      "though it was a case of a huge quantity of contraband articles ie 275 silver slabs worth rs 58650620 you awarded the sentence to each of the accused keeping in mind the period undergone by each of the accused as under trial prisoner and granted benefit of set off so that none of the accused had to remain in custody for any further period\n",
      "consequently the allegations against the appellant were that\n",
      "thus the manner and mode in which you awarded the sentence in crl case nos 67594  129395 clearly show that the accused had managed with you for showing favour in awarding sentence and accordingly you awarded the punishment fixing the term of sentence in such a way that the accused need not have to remain in custody for any longer period and thereby\n",
      "a you are guilty of indulging in corruptpractice\n",
      "b you are guilty of dereliction in discharging your judicial functions\n",
      "c you acted in a manner unbecoming of a judicial officer\n",
      "these acts of yours would amount to acts of grave misconduct and tantamount to conduct unbecoming of a judicial officer violating the provisions contained in rule 3 of the gujarat civil services conduct rules 1971\n",
      "6 the appellant denied the charges in his reply to the chargesheet an inquiry officer was appointed during the course of the inquiry witnesses were examined in support of the charges among them being the special government prosecutor and superintendent of customs the inquiry officer in his report dated 28 january 2004 came to the conclusion that there was no independent evidence to establish that the appellant had engaged in a corrupt practice the charges were held not to have been established the report of the inquiry officer was placed before a disciplinary committee of the high court consisting of two judges the disciplinary committee did not agree with the reasons adduced by the inquiry officer but nonetheless was of the view that the appellant should be exonerated in the view of the committee a huge quantity of contraband was involved and the appellant ought not to have taken a lenient view contrary to settled principles of law the disciplinary committee held that though there was an absence of sufficient evidence to establish an oblique motive or an allegation of corruption an element of doubt existed from the manner in which the appellant had sentenced each of the accused bearing in mind the period of custody as undertrial prisoners the committee was of the view that the acts of the appellant were not totally bona fide and proposed that this should be considered when the case of the appellant for promotion arose in future\n",
      "7 the report of the disciplinary committee was considered at a chamber meeting of the full court on 26 september 2005 when it was resolved to remand the matter to the same disciplinary committee for reconsideration the disciplinary committee considered the matter again the disciplinary committee took a fresh decision on 4 april 2006 to the effect that there being no evidence about corruption the finding of the inquiry officer was correct the committee however reiterated that the conduct of the appellant should be borne in mind when his case for promotion came up for consideration when the report of the disciplinary committee came up before the full court at a chamber meeting held on 5 march 2007 a reconstituted disciplinary committee was called upon to look into the matter again and to issue a notice to show cause to the appellant upon the resolution of the full court the disciplinary committee recorded tentative reasons to disagree with the report of the inquiry officer and called upon the appellant to show cause why he should not be held guilty of the charges levelled and be dismissed from the service the appellant responded to the notice to show cause and was granted a personal hearing the disciplinary committee arrived at a decision on 1 july 2009 holding the appellant guilty of the charges of misconduct the committee held that as a seasoned judicial officer who was in service since 1981 the appellant would be aware about the basic principles of sentencing the committee rejected the explanation of the appellant that even if an error was committed by him in awarding less than the prescribed sentence this was of a bona fide nature in the view of the committee the appellant ought to have seen the provisions of the customs act 1962 and having held the accused guilty he ought to have considered the provisions for punishment laid down in the statute the committee found it difficult to accept that as a judicial officer the appellant had passed an order of conviction and sentence without looking at the provisions the committee held that an inference could be drawn on the basis of material with regard to the existence of an oblique motive since neither a sufficient nor reasonable explanation was provided by the appellant alternatively the committee held that even assuming that there was no oblique motive the established facts reflected gross negligence and a dereliction of duty on the part of the appellant the committee found the charge of misconduct was established and came to the conclusion that the appellant should be dismissed from service under rule 6 of the gujarat civil services discipline and appeal rules 1971 the report of the disciplinary committee was adopted by the full court the state government by a notification dated 14 july 2009 dismissed the appellant from service\n",
      "8 the conduct of the appellant as a judicial officer formed the subject matter of another disciplinary inquiry inquiry 6 of 2001 in which a chargesheet was issued on 5 november 2001 the charges against the appellant were that despite his transfer on 23 april 1993 the appellant had with an oblique motive requested the chief judicial magistrate mehsana to transfer 26 out of several partheard cases selectively pertaining to offences under the prevention of food adulteration act the allegation was that these cases were indicated as being partheard though no material evidence had been recorded the second charge was that in 68 cases involving offences punishable under the factories act 1948 the appellant had imposed negligible punishments of fine ranging from rs 100 to rs 500 contrary to the decisions of the high court and had indulged in a corrupt practice the appellant was charged with a dereliction of duty and of acting in a manner unbecoming of a judicial officer the inquiry officer exonerated the appellant\n",
      "9 the disciplinary committee of the high court came to the conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to hold the appellant guilty of an oblique motive or corrupt practice at its chamber meeting on 26 september 2005 the full court remanded the proceedings to the disciplinary committee the disciplinary committee took a fresh decision and reiterated its earlier view when a full court considered the view of the disciplinary committee on 5 march 2007 a fresh disciplinary committee was assigned to relook into the matter and to issue a show cause notice to the appellant the disciplinary committee recorded its tentative disagreement with the report of the inquiry officer and issue a notice to the show cause to the appellant upon considering the reply submitted by the appellant the disciplinary committee in its decision rendered on 1 july 2009 held the charges to be proved and took the view that the appellant was liable to be dismissed from service the full court of the high court resolved that the charges against the appellant were proved and decided to dismiss the appellant from service the state government acting on the decision of the high court issue an order of dismissal on 14 july 2009\n",
      "10 the appellant initiated proceedings under article 226 of the constitution in order to assail the findings which were arrived at in the disciplinary proceedings and the punishment of dismissal by its judgment and order dated 23 february 2012 the division bench held that the charge of misconduct in disciplinary inquiry 6 of 2001 was not established the high court after adverting to the report of the disciplinary committee noted that there was no evidence in regard to which cases under the prevention of food adulteration act were partheard before the appellant this conclusion of the disciplinary committee was held to belie the charge that the appellant was being selective about retaining partheard cases on the second charge the division bench observed that the disciplinary committee had expressly concluded that there was insufficient evidence to hold the appellant guilty of an oblique motive or corrupt practice in the award of punishments in the cases under the factories act 1948 yet the final conclusion of the committee was that all the charges including the charge of corrupt practice stood proved the high court noted that this was a clear error the disciplinary committee having come to the conclusion of the absence of an oblique motive or corrupt practice the high court held that it was not open to convert the charge into one of gross negligence for these reasons the findings and conclusion of the disciplinary committee in inquiry 6 of 2001 were held not to be sustainable\n",
      "11 the high court however held that the charge of misconduct in disciplinary inquiry 15 of 2000 was based on evidence and it could not be held that the conclusions of the disciplinary committee which were adopted by the full court were based on no evidence the high court noted that the appellant was a judicial officer since 1982 and had worked for nearly fourteen years as a judge while dealing with offences under the customs act 1962 he was expected to refer to the penal provisions under which punishment was being handed down after recording a conviction the high court noted that the stand of the appellant appeared to be that he awarded the sentence without being aware of the statutory provisions the high court observed that the criminal case with which the appellant was dealing was not the first case involving an offence under section 135 the high court noted that despite the minimum punishment prescribed under section 135 the appellant awarded less than the minimum in the case of several accused no reasons appeared from the judgment for the grant of differential treatment to some of the accused more significantly the punishments awarded to all the accused were structured in such a manner that none of the accused would have to serve any further sentence after accounting for the setoff for the period spent in jail as under trial prisoner the high court noted that since the value of the goods in the case exceeded rupees one lakh section 135 provided for imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and with fine moreover in the absence of special and adequate reasons to the contrary to be recorded in the judgment of the court the imprisonment was not to be for less than three years section 135 3 also specifies what shall not be considered as special and adequate reasons the high court upheld the view of the disciplinary committee which were accepted by the full court that an inference of oblique motive would have to be drawn from the record having due regard to the fact that i the appellant had recorded no special or adequate reasons for awarding less than the minimum sentence and ii the sentences which were awarded to the accused were such that none of them would have to undergo any further term of imprisonment after taking into account the period undergone as an undertrial in the view of the high court the conclusions of the committee which were accepted by the full court cannot be held to have been based on no evidence there were strong circumstances indicating that the appellant imposed punishments in serious offences under the customs act 1962 contrary to statutory mandate his explanation that he was not aware of the statutory provision having been recently promoted as cjm was not acceptable there were glaring discrepancies in the award of punishments to various accused and most significantly the sentence imposed on each accused was such that none of them would remain in jail any longer the high court held that the punishment of dismissal was not disproportionate to the charge of misconduct which has been found to be established\n",
      "12 the first submission which has been urged on behalf of the appellant is that there was no warrant for the full court to require a reconsideration of the decision initially taken by the disciplinary committee on 27 october 2004 the submission is that once the disciplinary committee concluded that the appellant should be exonerated by accepting the report of the inquiry officer the full court in the chamber meeting had no jurisdiction to revisit that decision\n",
      "13 the submission suffers from a fundamental fallacy under article 235 of the constitution the high court exercises control over the district judiciary the exercise of disciplinary control is a manifestation of that power exercise of disciplinary control over the district judiciary is vested in the high court in pursuance of the provisions of article 235 the high court in order to streamline the process governing the exercise of its disciplinary jurisdiction may make  as high courts in fact do make  procedural provisions regulating its exercise the high court of gujarat in a meeting of a full court held on 2 march 2004 resolved that matters listed in annexure a to the resolution should be dealt with and decided by the high court as a whole action to be taken against judicial officers in the exercise of disciplinary jurisdiction was one of those matters however having due regard to the multitude of administrative matters over which the full court exercises jurisdiction the high court assigns and distributes its administrative functions to constituent committees this is imperative for the efficient exercise of the control of the high court over the district judiciary under article 235 distribution of work to a committee of the high court does not efface the jurisdiction that vests in the high court by a resolution that was passed in a chamber meeting of the high court held on 26 december 1998 a detailed procedure was enunciated for the conduct of disciplinary inquiries against judicial officers of the district judiciary the procedure envisages that after an inquiry officer submits a report the report together with underlying material on the record would be examined by a disciplinary committee consisting of two judges the disciplinary committee would submit its provisional conclusions in a report which would laid before the high court and this would become a decision of the court after a stipulated period the second stage for the disciplinary committee to prepare and submit its report would be after issuing a notice to show cause to the officer and granting him a personal hearing after which the disciplinary committee would prepare a report containing its reasoned conclusions regarding the punishment once again the report would be tabled before high court and would become a decision of the court after passage of a stipulated period the recommendation which is submitted by the disciplinary committee on whether or not to accept the report of an inquiry officer is not binding on the high court the full court has an obligation to apply its mind to a report which has been submitted by the disciplinary committee and to determine whether it should or should not be accepted hence there is no merit in the submission that the full court was bound by the decision of its disciplinary committee\n",
      "14 the second submission relates to the merits of the charges against the appellant which have been found to be established the submission of the appellant is that his judgment at the conclusion of the trial involving offences inter alia under section 135 of the customs act 1962 was a judicial decision the basis of the decision is contained in the reasons adduced by the appellant even if the appellant had erred in the matter of awarding the sentence under section 135 that  it was urged  cannot form the subject of a disciplinary inquiry moreover on the basis of the decision rendered by the appellant in the two criminal cases it was sought to be urged that the appellant had indicated reasons for arriving at a finding of the guilt and on the award of the sentence\n",
      "15 the issue of whether a judicial officer has been actuated by an oblique motive or corrupt practice has to be determined upon a careful appraisal of the material on the record direct evidence of corruption may not always be forthcoming in every case involving a misconduct of this nature a wanton breach of the governing principles of law or procedure may well be indicative in a given case of a motivated if not reckless disregard of legal principle in the absence of a cogent explanation to the contrary it is for the disciplinary authority to determine whether a pattern has emerged on the basis of which an inference that the judicial officer was actuated by extraneous considerations can be drawn cases involving misdemeanours of a judicial officer have to be dealt with sensitivity and care a robust common sense must guide the disciplinary authority at one end of the spectrum are those cases where direct evidence of a misdemeanour is available evidence in regard to the existence of an incriminating trail must be carefully scrutinized to determine whether an act of misconduct is established on the basis of legally acceptable evidence yet in other cases direct evidence of a decision being actuated by a corrupt motive may not be available the issue which arises in such cases is whether there are circumstances from which an inference that extraneous considerations have actuated a judicial officer can legitimately be drawn such an inference cannot obviously be drawn merely from a hypothesis that a decision is erroneous a wrong decision can yet be a bona fide error of judgment inadvertence is consistent with an honest error of judgment a charge of misconduct against a judicial officer must be distinguished from a purely erroneous decision whether on law or on fact the legality of a judicial determination is subject to such remedies as are provided in law for testing the correctness of the determination it is not the correctness of the verdict but the conduct of the officer which is in question the disciplinary authority has to determine whether there has emerged from the record one or more circumstances that indicate that the decision which forms the basis of the charge of misconduct was not an honest exercise of judicial power the circumstances let into evidence to establish misconduct have to be sifted and evaluated with caution the threat of disciplinary proceedings must not demotivate the honest and independent officer yet on the other hand there is a vital element of accountability to society involved in dealing with cases of misconduct there is on the one hand a genuine public interest in protecting fearless and honest officers of the district judiciary from motivated criticism and attack equally there is a genuine public interest in holding a person who is guilty of wrong doing responsible for his or his actions neither aspect of public interest can be ignored both are vital to the preservation of the integrity of the administration of justice\n",
      "16 in the present case it must be emphasised that the charges against the appellant involved rendering of decisions actuated by corrupt practice or by oblique motives the two criminal cases which were tried by the appellant involved offences under section 135 of the customs act 1962 section 135 is as follows\n",
      "section 135\n",
      "1 without prejudice to any action that may be taken under this act if any person\n",
      "a is in relation to any goods in any way knowingly concerned in any fraudulent evasion or attempt at evasion of any duty chargeable thereon or of any prohibition for the time being imposed under this act or any other law for the time being in force with respect to such goods or\n",
      "b acquires possession of or is in any way concerned in carrying removing depositing harbouring keeping concealing selling or purchasing or in any other manner dealing with any goods which he knows or has reasons to believe are liable to confiscation under section 111 he shall be punishable \n",
      "c in the case of an offence relating to any of the goods to which section 123 applies and the market price whereof exceeds one lakh of rupees with imprisonment for term which may extend to seven years and with fine \n",
      "provided that in the absence of special and adequate reasons to the contrary to be recorded in the judgment of the court such imprisonment shall not be for less than three years\n",
      "ii in any other case with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine or with both\n",
      "2 \n",
      "3 for the purpose of subsections 1 and 2 the following shall not be considered as special and adequate reasons for awarding a sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than one year namely\n",
      "i the fact that the accused has been convicted for the first time for an offence under this act\n",
      "ii the fact that in any proceedings under this act other than a prosecution the accused has been ordered to pay a penalty or the goods which are the subjectmatter of such proceedings have been ordered to be confiscated or any other action has been taken against him for the same act which constitutes the offence\n",
      "iii the fact that the accused was not the principal offender and was acting merely as a carrier of goods or otherwise was a secondary party to the commission to the offence\n",
      "iv the age of the accused\n",
      "17 it is not in dispute that the cases in question related to goods to which section 123 applied and the market price whereof exceeded rupees one lakh the offences were punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and with fine the proviso spells out that in the absence of special and adequate reasons to the contrary to be recorded in the judgment of the court such imprisonment shall not be for less than three years subsection 3 of section 123 provides what would not be considered as special and adequate reasons for awarding a sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than one year the appellant was evaluating in criminal case 675 of 1994 a situation involving the smuggling of 275 silver slabs worth rs 58650620 the explanation of the appellant that he was recently promoted to the cadre of cjm and was not aware of the provisions of section 135 was not accepted by the disciplinary committee or by the full court as a judicial officer who was in service for over fourteen years the appellant could not have been unmindful of and was duty bound to have read the governing provisions of the statute under which the offence was sought to be established it is inconceivable that a judicial officer would do so in two successive trials without apprising himself of the law or the punishment provided by the legislature the appellant awarded sentences ranging from three months to five years of imprisonment to different accused no reasons appear from the record of the judgment for awarding less than the minimum sentence prescribed\n",
      "18 we have duly perused the judgments rendered by the appellant and find merit in the finding of the high court that the appellant paid no heed whatsoever to the provisions of section 135 under which the sentence of imprisonment shall not be less than three years in the absence of special and adequate reasons to the contrary to be recorded in the judgment of the court most significant is the fact that the appellant imposed a sentence in the case of each accused in such a manner that after the order was passed no accused would remain in jail any longer two of the accused were handed down sentences of five months and three months in such a manner that after taking account of the setoff of the period during which they had remained as undertrial prisoners they would be released from jail the appellant had absolutely no convincing explanation for this course of conduct\n",
      "19 a disciplinary inquiry it is well settled is not governed by the strict rules of evidence which govern a criminal trial a charge of misconduct in a disciplinary proceeding has to be established on a preponderance of probabilities the high court while exercising its power of judicial review under article 226 has to determine as to whether the charge of misconduct stands established with reference to some legally acceptable evidence the high court would not interfere unless the findings are found to be perverse unless it is a case of no evidence the high court would not exercise its jurisdiction under article 226 if there is some legal evidence to hold that a charge of misconduct is proved the sufficiency of the evidence would not fall for reappreciation or reevaluation before the high court applying these tests it is not possible to fault the decision of the division bench of the gujarat high court on the charge of misconduct the charge of misconduct was established in disciplinary inquiry 15 of 2000\n",
      "20 that leads us to the issue of the punishment which has been imposed on the appellant the appellant has been dismissed from service the submission of the appellant is that having regard to the fact that he has an unblemished record of service the imposition of the punishment of dismissal would be disproportionate to the misconduct which has been found to be established rule 6 of the gujarat civil services discipline and appeals rules 1971 enunciates disciplinary penalties among them is i compulsory retirement ii removal from service which shall not be a disqualification for future employment under government iii dismissal from service which shall ordinarily be a disqualification for future employment under government the punishment must be proportionate to the misconduct established having due regard to the nature of the misconduct which has been found to be established and the totality of circumstances we are of the view that the punishment of dismissal should stand substituted by an order of compulsory retirement the appellant has attained the age of superannuation and would be entitled to his retirement benefits on that basis\n",
      "21 we accordingly allow the appeals in part we confirm the judgment of the high court in so far as it rejects the challenge by the appellant to the finding of misconduct however for the reasons which we have indicated above we direct that the order of dismissal from service shall stand substituted with an order of compulsory retirement which shall take effect from 14 july 2009 the date on which the final order of penalty was imposed upon the appellant\n",

      "4 in criminal case 1293 of 1995 the appellant delivered a judgment on 22 january 1997 convicting the accused but awarded a sentence of imprisonment less than the minimum prescribed by section 135 moreover the sentence of imprisonment was so structured that after allowing the benefit of a setoff the accused was not required to remain in jail for a further period in the second criminal case criminal case 675 of 1994 the trial involved offences inter alia under section 135 of the customs act 1962 fourteen accused were alleged to be involved in the smuggling of 275 silver slabs of a value of rs 58650620 the trial of two of the accused who are absconding was separated from the rest by a judgment dated 11 march 1997 the appellant held the twelve accused who were brought to trial to be guilty of the charges however save and except for five of the accused persons the appellant awarded less than the minimum punishment prescribed under section 135 all the accused were granted a setoff details of the sentences awarded are contained in the following table\n",
      "5 this formed the subject matter of departmental inquiry 15 of 2000 in which a chargesheet was issued on 31 august 2001 it was alleged that the appellant who was a senior judicial officer was aware of the provisions of section 135 which prescribe the award of at least a minimum sentence the case involved smuggling of a huge quantity of contraband articles the appellant it was alleged was aware of judicial decisions mandating that a liberal view should not be taken in the award of sentences in such cases yet with the intention of favouring the accused the appellant was alleged to have awarded less than the minimum sentence without recording special or adequate reasons moreover it was alleged that\n",
      "though it was a case of a huge quantity of contraband articles ie 275 silver slabs worth rs 58650620 you awarded the sentence to each of the accused keeping in mind the period undergone by each of the accused as under trial prisoner and granted benefit of set off so that none of the accused had to remain in custody for any further period\n",
      "consequently the allegations against the appellant were that\n",
      "thus the manner and mode in which you awarded the sentence in crl case nos 67594  129395 clearly show that the accused had managed with you for showing favour in awarding sentence and accordingly you awarded the punishment fixing the term of sentence in such a way that the accused need not have to remain in custody for any longer period and thereby\n",
      "a you are guilty of indulging in corruptpractice\n",
      "b you are guilty of dereliction in discharging your judicial functions\n",
      "c you acted in a manner unbecoming of a judicial officer\n",
      "these acts of yours would amount to acts of grave misconduct and tantamount to conduct unbecoming of a judicial officer violating the provisions contained in rule 3 of the gujarat civil services conduct rules 1971\n",
      "6 the appellant denied the charges in his reply to the chargesheet an inquiry officer was appointed during the course of the inquiry witnesses were examined in support of the charges among them being the special government prosecutor and superintendent of customs the inquiry officer in his report dated 28 january 2004 came to the conclusion that there was no independent evidence to establish that the appellant had engaged in a corrupt practice the charges were held not to have been established the report of the inquiry officer was placed before a disciplinary committee of the high court consisting of two judges the disciplinary committee did not agree with the reasons adduced by the inquiry officer but nonetheless was of the view that the appellant should be exonerated in the view of the committee a huge quantity of contraband was involved and the appellant ought not to have taken a lenient view contrary to settled principles of law the disciplinary committee held that though there was an absence of sufficient evidence to establish an oblique motive or an allegation of corruption an element of doubt existed from the manner in which the appellant had sentenced each of the accused bearing in mind the period of custody as undertrial prisoners the committee was of the view that the acts of the appellant were not totally bona fide and proposed that this should be considered when the case of the appellant for promotion arose in future\n",
      "7 the report of the disciplinary committee was considered at a chamber meeting of the full court on 26 september 2005 when it was resolved to remand the matter to the same disciplinary committee for reconsideration the disciplinary committee considered the matter again the disciplinary committee took a fresh decision on 4 april 2006 to the effect that there being no evidence about corruption the finding of the inquiry officer was correct the committee however reiterated that the conduct of the appellant should be borne in mind when his case for promotion came up for consideration when the report of the disciplinary committee came up before the full court at a chamber meeting held on 5 march 2007 a reconstituted disciplinary committee was called upon to look into the matter again and to issue a notice to show cause to the appellant upon the resolution of the full court the disciplinary committee recorded tentative reasons to disagree with the report of the inquiry officer and called upon the appellant to show cause why he should not be held guilty of the charges levelled and be dismissed from the service the appellant responded to the notice to show cause and was granted a personal hearing the disciplinary committee arrived at a decision on 1 july 2009 holding the appellant guilty of the charges of misconduct the committee held that as a seasoned judicial officer who was in service since 1981 the appellant would be aware about the basic principles of sentencing\n",
      "the committee rejected the explanation of the appellant that even if an error was committed by him in awarding less than the prescribed sentence this was of a bona fide nature in the view of the committee the appellant ought to have seen the provisions of the customs act 1962 and having held the accused guilty he ought to have considered the provisions for punishment laid down in the statute the committee found it difficult to accept that as a judicial officer the appellant had passed an order of conviction and sentence without looking at the provisions the committee held that an inference could be drawn on the basis of material with regard to the existence of an oblique motive since neither a sufficient nor reasonable explanation was provided by the appellant alternatively the committee held that even assuming that there was no oblique motive the established facts reflected gross negligence and a dereliction of duty on the part of the appellant the committee found the charge of misconduct was established and came to the conclusion that the appellant should be dismissed from service under rule 6 of the gujarat civil services discipline and appeal rules 1971 the report of the disciplinary committee was adopted by the full court the state government by a notification dated 14 july 2009 dismissed the appellant from service\n",
      "8 the conduct of the appellant as a judicial officer formed the subject matter of another disciplinary inquiry inquiry 6 of 2001 in which a chargesheet was issued on 5 november 2001 the charges against the appellant were that despite his transfer on 23 april 1993 the appellant had with an oblique motive requested the chief judicial magistrate mehsana to transfer 26 out of several partheard cases selectively pertaining to offences under the prevention of food adulteration act the allegation was that these cases were indicated as being partheard though no material evidence had been recorded the second charge was that in 68 cases involving offences punishable under the factories act 1948 the appellant had imposed negligible punishments of fine ranging from rs 100 to rs 500 contrary to the decisions of the high court and had indulged in a corrupt practice the appellant was charged with a dereliction of duty and of acting in a manner unbecoming of a judicial officer the inquiry officer exonerated the appellant\n",
      "9 the disciplinary committee of the high court came to the conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to hold the appellant guilty of an oblique motive or corrupt practice at its chamber meeting on 26 september 2005 the full court remanded the proceedings to the disciplinary committee the disciplinary committee took a fresh decision and reiterated its earlier view when a full court considered the view of the disciplinary committee on 5 march 2007 a fresh disciplinary committee was assigned to relook into the matter and to issue a show cause notice to the appellant the disciplinary committee recorded its tentative disagreement with the report of the inquiry officer and issue a notice to the show cause to the appellant upon considering the reply submitted by the appellant the disciplinary committee in its decision rendered on 1 july 2009 held the charges to be proved and took the view that the appellant was liable to be dismissed from service the full court of the high court resolved that the charges against the appellant were proved and decided to dismiss the appellant from service the state government acting on the decision of the high court issue an order of dismissal on 14 july 2009\n",
      "10 the appellant initiated proceedings under article 226 of the constitution in order to assail the findings which were arrived at in the disciplinary proceedings and the punishment of dismissal by its judgment and order dated 23 february 2012 the division bench held that the charge of misconduct in disciplinary inquiry 6 of 2001 was not established the high court after adverting to the report of the disciplinary committee noted that there was no evidence in regard to which cases under the prevention of food adulteration act were partheard before the appellant this conclusion of the disciplinary committee was held to belie the charge that the appellant was being selective about retaining partheard cases on the second charge the division bench observed that the disciplinary committee had expressly concluded that there was insufficient evidence to hold the appellant guilty of an oblique motive or corrupt practice in the award of punishments in the cases under the factories act 1948 yet the final conclusion of the committee was that all the charges including the charge of corrupt practice stood proved the high court noted that this was a clear error the disciplinary committee having come to the conclusion of the absence of an oblique motive or corrupt practice the high court held that it was not open to convert the charge into one of gross negligence for these reasons the findings and conclusion of the disciplinary committee in inquiry 6 of 2001 were held not to be sustainable\n",
      "11 the high court however held that the charge of misconduct in disciplinary inquiry 15 of 2000 was based on evidence and it could not be held that the conclusions of the disciplinary committee which were adopted by the full court were based on no evidence the high court noted that the appellant was a judicial officer since 1982 and had worked for nearly fourteen years as a judge while dealing with offences under the customs act 1962 he was expected to refer to the penal provisions under which punishment was being handed down after recording a conviction the high court noted that the stand of the appellant appeared to be that he awarded the sentence without being aware of the statutory provisions the high court observed that the criminal case with which the appellant was dealing was not the first case involving an offence under section 135 the high court noted that despite the minimum punishment prescribed under section 135 the appellant awarded less than the minimum in the case of several accused no reasons appeared from the judgment for the grant of differential treatment to some of the accused more significantly the punishments awarded to all the accused were structured in such a manner that none of the accused would have to serve any further sentence after accounting for the setoff for the period spent in jail as under trial prisoner the high court noted that since the value of the goods in the case exceeded rupees one lakh section 135 provided for imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and with fine moreover in the absence of special and adequate reasons to the contrary to be recorded in the judgment of the court the imprisonment was not to be for less than three years section 135 3 also specifies what shall not be considered as special and adequate reasons\n",
      "the high court upheld the view of the disciplinary committee which were accepted by the full court that an inference of oblique motive would have to be drawn from the record having due regard to the fact that i the appellant had recorded no special or adequate reasons for awarding less than the minimum sentence and ii the sentences which were awarded to the accused were such that none of them would have to undergo any further term of imprisonment after taking into account the period undergone as an undertrial in the view of the high court the conclusions of the committee which were accepted by the full court cannot be held to have been based on no evidence there were strong circumstances indicating that the appellant imposed punishments in serious offences under the customs act 1962 contrary to statutory mandate his explanation that he was not aware of the statutory provision having been recently promoted as cjm was not acceptable there were glaring discrepancies in the award of punishments to various accused and most significantly the sentence imposed on each accused was such that none of them would remain in jail any longer the high court held that the punishment of dismissal was not disproportionate to the charge of misconduct which has been found to be established\n",
      "12 the first submission which has been urged on behalf of the appellant is that there was no warrant for the full court to require a reconsideration of the decision initially taken by the disciplinary committee on 27 october 2004 the submission is that once the disciplinary committee concluded that the appellant should be exonerated by accepting the report of the inquiry officer the full court in the chamber meeting had no jurisdiction to revisit that decision\n",
      "13 the submission suffers from a fundamental fallacy under article 235 of the constitution the high court exercises control over the district judiciary the exercise of disciplinary control is a manifestation of that power exercise of disciplinary control over the district judiciary is vested in the high court in pursuance of the provisions of article 235 the high court in order to streamline the process governing the exercise of its disciplinary jurisdiction may make  as high courts in fact do make  procedural provisions regulating its exercise the high court of gujarat in a meeting of a full court held on 2 march 2004 resolved that matters listed in annexure a to the resolution should be dealt with and decided by the high court as a whole action to be taken against judicial officers in the exercise of disciplinary jurisdiction was one of those matters however having due regard to the multitude of administrative matters over which the full court exercises jurisdiction the high court assigns and distributes its administrative functions to constituent committees this is imperative for the efficient exercise of the control of the high court over the district judiciary under article 235 distribution of work to a committee of the high court does not efface the jurisdiction that vests in the high court by a resolution that was passed in a chamber meeting of the high court held on 26 december 1998 a detailed procedure was enunciated for the conduct of disciplinary inquiries against judicial officers of the district judiciary the procedure envisages that after an inquiry officer submits a report the report together with underlying material on the record would be examined by a disciplinary committee consisting of two judges the disciplinary committee would submit its provisional conclusions in a report which would laid before the high court and this would become a decision of the court after a stipulated period the second stage for the disciplinary committee to prepare and submit its report would be after issuing a notice to show cause to the officer and granting him a personal hearing after which the disciplinary committee would prepare a report containing its reasoned conclusions regarding the punishment once again the report would be tabled before high court and would become a decision of the court after passage of a stipulated period the recommendation which is submitted by the disciplinary committee on whether or not to accept the report of an inquiry officer is not binding on the high court the full court has an obligation to apply its mind to a report which has been submitted by the disciplinary committee and to determine whether it should or should not be accepted hence there is no merit in the submission that the full court was bound by the decision of its disciplinary committee\n",
      "14 the second submission relates to the merits of the charges against the appellant which have been found to be established the submission of the appellant is that his judgment at the conclusion of the trial involving offences inter alia under section 135 of the customs act 1962 was a judicial decision the basis of the decision is contained in the reasons adduced by the appellant even if the appellant had erred in the matter of awarding the sentence under section 135 that  it was urged  cannot form the subject of a disciplinary inquiry moreover on the basis of the decision rendered by the appellant in the two criminal cases it was sought to be urged that the appellant had indicated reasons for arriving at a finding of the guilt and on the award of the sentence\n",
      "15 the issue of whether a judicial officer has been actuated by an oblique motive or corrupt practice has to be determined upon a careful appraisal of the material on the record direct evidence of corruption may not always be forthcoming in every case involving a misconduct of this nature a wanton breach of the governing principles of law or procedure may well be indicative in a given case of a motivated if not reckless disregard of legal principle in the absence of a cogent explanation to the contrary it is for the disciplinary authority to determine whether a pattern has emerged on the basis of which an inference that the judicial officer was actuated by extraneous considerations can be drawn cases involving misdemeanours of a judicial officer have to be dealt with sensitivity and care a robust common sense must guide the disciplinary authority at one end of the spectrum are those cases where direct evidence of a misdemeanour is available evidence in regard to the existence of an incriminating trail must be carefully scrutinized to determine whether an act of misconduct is established on the basis of legally acceptable evidence yet in other cases direct evidence of a decision being actuated by a corrupt motive may not be available the issue which arises in such cases is whether there are circumstances from which an inference that extraneous considerations have actuated a judicial officer can legitimately be drawn such an inference cannot obviously be drawn merely from a hypothesis that a decision is erroneous a wrong decision can yet be a bona fide error of judgment inadvertence is consistent with an honest error of judgment a charge of misconduct against a judicial officer must be distinguished from a purely erroneous decision whether on law or on fact the legality of a judicial determination is subject to such remedies as are provided in law for testing the correctness of the determination it is not the correctness of the verdict but the conduct of the officer which is in question the disciplinary authority has to determine whether there has emerged from the record one or more circumstances that indicate that the decision which forms the basis of the charge of misconduct was not an honest exercise of judicial power the circumstances let into evidence to establish misconduct have to be sifted and evaluated with caution the threat of disciplinary proceedings must not demotivate the honest and independent officer yet on the other hand there is a vital element of accountability to society involved in dealing with cases of misconduct there is on the one hand a genuine public interest in protecting fearless and honest officers of the district judiciary from motivated criticism and attack equally there is a genuine public interest in holding a person who is guilty of wrong doing responsible for his or his actions neither aspect of public interest can be ignored both are vital to the preservation of the integrity of the administration of justice\n",
      "16 in the present case it must be emphasised that the charges against the appellant involved rendering of decisions actuated by corrupt practice or by oblique motives the two criminal cases which were tried by the appellant involved offences under section 135 of the customs act 1962 section 135 is as follows\n",
      "section 135\n",
      "1 without prejudice to any action that may be taken under this act if any person\n",
      "a is in relation to any goods in any way knowingly concerned in any fraudulent evasion or attempt at evasion of any duty chargeable thereon or of any prohibition for the time being imposed under this act or any other law for the time being in force with respect to such goods or\n",
      "b acquires possession of or is in any way concerned in carrying removing depositing harbouring keeping concealing selling or purchasing or in any other manner dealing with any goods which he knows or has reasons to believe are liable to confiscation under section 111 he shall be punishable \n",
      "c in the case of an offence relating to any of the goods to which section 123 applies and the market price whereof exceeds one lakh of rupees with imprisonment for term which may extend to seven years and with fine \n",
      "provided that in the absence of special and adequate reasons to the contrary to be recorded in the judgment of the court such imprisonment shall not be for less than three years\n",
      "ii in any other case with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine or with both\n",
      "2 \n",
      "3 for the purpose of subsections 1 and 2 the following shall not be considered as special and adequate reasons for awarding a sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than one year namely\n",
      "i the fact that the accused has been convicted for the first time for an offence under this act\n",
      "ii the fact that in any proceedings under this act other than a prosecution the accused has been ordered to pay a penalty or the goods which are the subjectmatter of such proceedings have been ordered to be confiscated or any other action has been taken against him for the same act which constitutes the offence\n",
      "iii the fact that the accused was not the principal offender and was acting merely as a carrier of goods or otherwise was a secondary party to the commission to the offence\n",
      "iv the age of the accused\n",
      "17 it is not in dispute that the cases in question related to goods to which section 123 applied and the market price whereof exceeded rupees one lakh the offences were punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and with fine the proviso spells out that in the absence of special and adequate reasons to the contrary to be recorded in the judgment of the court such imprisonment shall not be for less than three years subsection 3 of section 123 provides what would not be considered as special and adequate reasons for awarding a sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than one year the appellant was evaluating in criminal case 675 of 1994 a situation involving the smuggling of 275 silver slabs worth rs 58650620 the explanation of the appellant that he was recently promoted to the cadre of cjm and was not aware of the provisions of section 135 was not accepted by the disciplinary committee or by the full court as a judicial officer who was in service for over fourteen years the appellant could not have been unmindful of and was duty bound to have read the governing provisions of the statute under which the offence was sought to be established it is inconceivable that a judicial officer would do so in two successive trials without apprising himself of the law or the punishment provided by the legislature the appellant awarded sentences ranging from three months to five years of imprisonment to different accused no reasons appear from the record of the judgment for awarding less than the minimum sentence prescribed\n",
      "18 we have duly perused the judgments rendered by the appellant and find merit in the finding of the high court that the appellant paid no heed whatsoever to the provisions of section 135 under which the sentence of imprisonment shall not be less than three years in the absence of special and adequate reasons to the contrary to be recorded in the judgment of the court most significant is the fact that the appellant imposed a sentence in the case of each accused in such a manner that after the order was passed no accused would remain in jail any longer two of the accused were handed down sentences of five months and three months in such a manner that after taking account of the setoff of the period during which they had remained as undertrial prisoners they would be released from jail the appellant had absolutely no convincing explanation for this course of conduct\n",
      "19 a disciplinary inquiry it is well settled is not governed by the strict rules of evidence which govern a criminal trial a charge of misconduct in a disciplinary proceeding has to be established on a preponderance of probabilities the high court while exercising its power of judicial review under article 226 has to determine as to whether the charge of misconduct stands established with reference to some legally acceptable evidence the high court would not interfere unless the findings are found to be perverse unless it is a case of no evidence the high court would not exercise its jurisdiction under article 226 if there is some legal evidence to hold that a charge of misconduct is proved the sufficiency of the evidence would not fall for reappreciation or reevaluation before the high court applying these tests it is not possible to fault the decision of the division bench of the gujarat high court on the charge of misconduct the charge of misconduct was established in disciplinary inquiry 15 of 2000\n",
      "20 that leads us to the issue of the punishment which has been imposed on the appellant the appellant has been dismissed from service the submission of the appellant is that having regard to the fact that he has an unblemished record of service the imposition of the punishment of dismissal would be disproportionate to the misconduct which has been found to be established rule 6 of the gujarat civil services discipline and appeals rules 1971 enunciates disciplinary penalties among them is i compulsory retirement ii removal from service which shall not be a disqualification for future employment under government iii dismissal from service which shall ordinarily be a disqualification for future employment under government the punishment must be proportionate to the misconduct established having due regard to the nature of the misconduct which has been found to be established and the totality of circumstances we are of the view that the punishment of dismissal should stand substituted by an order of compulsory retirement the appellant has attained the age of superannuation and would be entitled to his retirement benefits on that basis\n",
      "21 we accordingly allow the appeals in part we confirm the judgment of the high court in so far as it rejects the challenge by the appellant to the finding of misconduct however for the reasons which we have indicated above we direct that the order of dismissal from service shall stand substituted with an order of compulsory retirement which shall take effect from 14 july 2009 the date on which the final order of penalty was imposed upon the appellant\n",

      "2  shortly stated the facts of the case are that mr jain husband of the respondent writ petitioner was working as assistant with the state bank at karhall branch agra in the state of up in september 1995 he was placed under suspension and chargesheeted for having committed gross misconduct of embezzlement misappropriation departmental inquiry was instituted against him wherein he was found guilty in 1996 on the basis of findings recorded by the inquiry officer and accepted by the disciplinary authority major punishment was imposed on him by which his basic pay was reduced by two stages and five annual future increments were also stopped with cumulative effect husband of the writpetitioner however died on january 25 2000 while in service in the state bank\n",
      "3  the state bank had framed a scheme for appointment on compassionate grounds for dependents of deceased employeesemployees retired on medical grounds with effect from january 01 1979 it was modified from time to time at the relevant time when the husband of the writpetitioner died january 25 2000 the policy as amended with effect from january 01 1998 was in force\n",
      "4  in accordance with the policy of giving employment on compassionate ground to dependents of a deceased employee the writ petitioner as the widow of the deceased applied to the state bank in march 2000 the competent authority of the bank considered the case of the writ petitioner and keeping in view the punishment imposed on the deceased employee it rejected the prayer of the writ petitioner and informed her that no such appointment could be given to her a representation was made by the writ petitioner but it was also rejected on july 16 2001\n",
      "5  aggrieved by the action of the state bank the writ petitioner filed a petition in the high court by invoking art 226 of the constitution a single judge of the high court after referring to the scheme of giving appointment on compassionate grounds to dependents of deceased employees and also considering the case of the writpetitioner allowed the petition holding that the writ petitioner was entitled to the benefit of appointment on compassionate ground as the dependent of the deceased employee the said right which had accrued in her favour could not be taken away by the state bank only on the ground of misconduct on the part of her husband for which he was punished observed the single judge accordingly a direction was issued by the single judge to appoint the writ petitioner\n",
      "6  the state bank being aggrieved by the said order approached the division bench of the high court by filing intracourt appeal but the division bench also confirmed the order passed by the learned single judge and dismissed the appeal the said order is challenged in the present appeal\n",
      "7  notice was issued on may 17 2007 and after hearing the parties the registry was directed to place the matter for final hearing on may 01 2008 we have accordingly heard learned counsel for the parties\n",
      "8  the learned counsel for the appellantbank contended that the orders passed by the high court are illegal improper and contrary to law it was submitted that appointment on compassionate ground is never considered to be a right of a dependent of deceased employee it is a benefit granted to a dependent of an employee who dies in harness and is thus an exception to the general rule of equality clause guaranteed by art 14 of the constitution such appointment hence can only be given in accordance with the policy adopted or scheme framed by the employer\n",
      "9  it was also submitted that if the employee has committed misconduct for which he was punished the dependent of such employee cannot claim the benefit of appointment on compassionate ground according to the counsel both the courts were wholly wrong in holding that the writ petitioner was sought to be punished for so called misdeeds of the deceased employee the counsel submitted that there was no question of punishing the writ petitioner in not granting appointment on compassionate ground the husband of the writ petitioner had committed misconduct which was proved in the inquiry instituted against him and he was punished as per the policy the writ petitioner cannot claim appointment on compassionate ground there was no accrued right in favour of the writpetitioner the order passed by the learned single judge and confirmed by the division bench therefore deserves to be set aside\n",
      "10  alternatively it was submitted that even if a dependent of the deceased employee is held eligible to get an appointment on compassionate ground it is well settled law that mandamus can be issued against the employer limited to ordering him to consider the case of such applicant no direction can be issued to appoint the writpetitioner on compassionate ground even on that count the orders are liable to be set aside\n",
      "11  the learned counsel for the writ petitioner on the other hand supported the order passed by the learned single judge and confirmed by the division bench it was submitted that for the so called misconduct the husband of the writ petitioner was already punished the matter therefore ended there thereafter it was not open to the bank in the light of the policy in vogue to refuse appointment on compassionate ground to deprive the writ petitioner of such appointment the learned single judge was therefore right in allowing the petition and the division bench was not wrong in not interfering with the said order\n",
      "12  the counsel conceded that normally a writ court will direct the employer only to consider the case of the dependent of deceased employee for appointment on compassionate ground he however submitted that on the facts of the case the only ground which weighed with the bank was that the husband of the writ petitioner was punished and hence his widow could not be granted the benefit under the scheme if in the light of the said fact an order was passed to appoint the writ petitioner it could not be said that by issuing such direction the learned single judge had exceeded his jurisdiction the division bench was therefore right in dismissing the appeal and no interference is called for in exercise of discretionary jurisdiction uart 136 of the constitution\n",
      "13  having heard learned counsel for the parties in our opinion the appeal deserves to be allowed by setting aside the order passed by the learned single judge and confirmed by the division bench\n",
      "14  it is an admitted fact that the husband of the writ petitioner was serving with the appellant bank he indulged in illegalities and committed misconduct for which departmental proceedings were initiated against him an inquiry officer was appointed who after giving opportunity of hearing to the deceased employee recorded a finding that the charges levelled against the employee were proved a report was submitted by the inquiry officer to the disciplinary authority the disciplinary authority after following the principles of natural justice and affording opportunity of hearing to the employee by supplying a copy of the inquiry officers report agreed with the findings and imposed major penalty by reducing basic pay of the delinquent by two stages and stoppage of five annual future increments with cumulative effect the said order had attained finality\n",
      "15  it is also not in dispute that in january 2000 the employee expired and an application for appointment on compassionate ground was submitted by his widow the writ petitioner at that time the appellant bank was governed by scheme which was in force with effect from january 01 1978 as amended up to january 01 1998\n",
      "16  the counsel for the state bank invited our attention to the scheme for appointment on compassionate grounds for dependents of deceased employees as per the policy such benefit could be granted in certain cases para 6 of the scheme laid down method of appointment cl d of the said para dealt with cases where disciplinary actions had been taken against an employee the said clause read as under\n",
      "d in cases where disciplinary action had been taken against the employee or disciplinary proceedings were pending contemplated against himher appointment of a dependent on compassionate grounds may be considered only after obtaining prior government concurrence\n",
      "17  since the disciplinary proceedings against the deceased employee culminated in major punishment and an application was made by his widow for appointing her on compassionate ground the bank referred the matter to the government of india the matter was considered by the government but it was remitted to the bank to take an appropriate decision in accordance with law\n",
      "18  the bank again considered the proposal for appointment on compassionate ground of the writpetitioner but declined to grant such benefit in view of punishment imposed on her husband\n",
      "19  in para 3 of the communication dated january 29 2001 the managing director of the appellant bank stated\n",
      "in this connection we have to advise that although our scheme for compassionate appointments does not explicitly state that the deceased employee should have had unblemished service this is implied in view of the gross misconduct of late dk jain the competent authority at this office has declined the proposal for compassionate appointment of his wife smt anju jain in the bank\n",
      "20  it was submitted on behalf of the bank that if the services of the employee were not fully satisfactory and he was found guilty at the departmental inquiry and was punished for misconduct it was open to the employer not to grant the benefit of appointment on compassionate ground to the dependent of such tainted employee after his death if on that ground an order is passed it cannot be objected on the ground that no such action could have been taken\n",
      "21  in our opinion the submission is wellfounded and must be upheld the learned counsel for the state bank also referred to the scheme for compassionate appointments as framed in 1979 and amended in 1998 which was further amended in 2003 the said scheme reads as\n",

      "f the dependents of an employee who has died or who has retired on health grounds and whose service record was blemished on account of disciplinary action having been taken against him will be ineligible for compassionate appointment in the bank\n",
      "23  bare reading of the above clause makes it abundantly clear that the dependent of an employee who had died or retired on medical ground but whose service record was blemished on account of disciplinary action having been taken against him will not be considered eligible for compassionate appointment in the bank\n",
      "24  as observed earlier the writ petitioner approached the high court relying on the scheme for compassionate appointment of 1979 as amended with effect from january 01 1998 it was submitted by her that her husband was an employee of the bank departmental proceedings were initiated and he was punished it was thereafter not open to the appellant bank to refuse appointment to her on compassionate ground as she could not be punished for misdeeds alleged to have been committed by her husband\n",
      "25  the submission weighed with the learned single judge who allowed the petition and observed\n",
      "i have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and looked into the record of the case as well as the authorities cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner and i find that at the time when the petitioner applied for compassionate appointment on the death of her deceased husband the earlier scheme was applicable to the petitioners case and the amended scheme came into force from may 2002 i am of the view that the inapplicable provisions of the clauses of the amended scheme could not be taken resort to by the respondents as a ground to deprivescuttle the rightful benefits that accrued to the petitioner only due to some charges of misconduct of the deceased husband of the petitioner for which he had already been penalized no past acts of misconduct of the employee who dies in harness can be taken into account while considering the case of a family member for employment on compassionate ground as it is not a benefit provided to the deceased employee but for providing immediate succor to its dependents to survive the decision of the respondents is impermissible in the eye of law being in violation of the principles of natural justice\n",
      "the single judge hence issued the following directions\n",
      "in the result the petition succeeds and is allowed and the impugned orders dated 21052001 and 16072001 annexure no 2 and 4 to the writ petition are hereby quashed accordingly the respondentbank is directed to provide an appointment to the petitioner on compassionate ground on account of the death of her husband in accordance with law and in terms of the earlier scheme which was in force at that time within one month from the date a certified copy of this order is placed before the concerned authorityrespondent bank there will be no order as to costs\n",
      "26  when the appeal was filed by the state bank against the order passed by the single judge the division bench held that the learned single judge was right in issuing necessary directions and there was no infirmity the division bench observed\n",
      "from the record it is evident that after the death of the said employee the present appellants have also changed the scheme and introduced cl 1 to appointment on compassionate grounds past misconduct of an employee who dies in harness should also be taken into consideration while considering the application for compassionate employment of his dependent however the said amendment in the policy does not operate retrospectively and the learned single judge has rightly held that past act of misconduct of the said employee could not have been taken into consideration\n",
      "27  we are of the view that both the courts were wrong in granting relief to the writ petitioner appointment on compassionate ground is never considered a right of a person in fact such appointment is violative of rule of equality enshrined and guaranteed under art 14 of the constitution as per settled law when any appointment is to be made in government or semigovernment or in public office cases of all eligible candidates must be considered alike that is the mandate of art 14 normally therefore state or its instrumentality making any appointment to public office cannot ignore such mandate at the same time however in certain circumstances appointment on compassionate ground of dependents of deceased employee is considered inevitable so that the family of the deceased employee may not starve the primary object of such scheme is to save the bereaved family from sudden financial crisis occurring due to death of sole bread earner it is thus an exception to the general rule of equality and not another independent and parallel source of employment\n",
      "28  in our opinion therefore if disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against an employee and the charges levelled against such employee are proved and he is punished it is indeed a relevant consideration for not extending the benefit to dependent of such employee on the ground that he was punished to us it cannot be said that it is a case of double jeopardy or a dual punishment compassionate appointment is really a concession in favour of dependents of deceased employee if during his carrier he had committed illegalities and the misconduct is proved and he is punished obviously his dependents cannot claim right to the employment with respect the learned single judge was wholly wrong in observing that such an action would be violative of principles of natural justice\n",
      "to us the observation of the learned single judge that\n",
      "no past acts of misconduct of the employee who dies in harness can be taken into account while considering the case of a family member for employment on compassionate ground is not in consonance with law past conduct of an employee is undoubtedly an important consideration we are also of the view that the state bank was right in rejecting the prayer of the wife of the deceased employee vide its letter dated january 29 2001 observing therein that unblemished service record is implicit \n",
      "29  the learned counsel for the bank invited our attention to a decision of the high court of delhi in suman lata yadav v union of india  anr 2004 113 dellt 152 2004 indlaw del 150 in that case widow of a deceased employee sought employment on compassionate ground following death of her husband the request was declined the widow approached the high court by filing a writ petition a counter affidavit was filed by the union of india stating therein that on account of disciplinary proceedings and punishment meted out to the deceased the request of the widow for appointment on compassionate ground was turned down\n",
      "30  it was contended on behalf of the widow that the action of the union of india was illegal and appointment on compassionate ground could not be denied\n",
      "31  dismissing the petition and negativing the argument on behalf of the widow a single judge of the high court stated\n",
      "i am unable to accept this submission while it is true that the prime object is to provide succour and immediate relief yet the deceaseds service record or the factum of disciplinary proceedings and punishment meted out to him cannot be said to be an irrelevant factor the possibility of denial of compassionate appointment to the lrs of deceased on account of deceased employee having a tainted service record would serve as a deterrent to employees from indulging in misconduct it can act as an incentive for those maintaining discipline and probity besides when the availability of appointment and opportunities is limited there is nothing wrong in preferring lrs of those employees with clean record over the lrs of those who have had a tainted record\n",
      "32  in our opinion the above observations lay down correct proposition of law and we approve them\n",
      "33  to us therefore the state bank was right in refusing appointment on compassionate ground to the widow of deceased employee of the bank even under the policy in force in year 2000 we see no illegality in the action we hold that the learned single judge as well as the division bench was not right in observing that since the deceased employee was punished the matter ended there and the said punishment would be of no consequence so far as appointment of his dependent on compassionate ground of the deceased employee was concerned\n",
      "34  even on second ground the submission of the bank is wellfounded as noted earlier the learned single judge issued direction to the bank to appoint the writ petitionerwidow of the deceased employee within one month as per settled law a writ of mandamus can be issued directing the authority to consider the case of the petitioner for an appointment or promotion as the case may be but no direction can be given to appoint or promote a person\n",

      "36  allowing the appeal and setting aside the direction of the high court ordering the state to give promotion this court held that at the most the high court could have issued mandamus directing the state to reconsider the case of the writ petitioner on the correct principle it could not have issued a direction to the employer to promote the writ petitioner with retrospective effect syed mahmood was followed by this court in several cases\n",
      "37  the learned counsel for the respondent no doubt referred to a decision in state of bihar v dr braj kumar mishra  ors 1999 9 scc 546 1999 indlaw sc 489 wherein this court held that normally mandamus can be issued by a writ court directing the authority to consider the case of the writ petitioner in exceptional circumstances however a positive direction can be issued by granting relief in favour of the writ petitioner if the court is otherwise satisfied\n",
      "the court stated\n",
      "it is true that normally the court in exercise of its power under article 226227 of the constitution of india after quashing the impugned order should remand the matter to the concerned authority particularly when such authority consists of experts for deciding the issue afresh in accordance with the directions issued and the law laid down by it but in specified cases as the instant case nothing prevented the court to issue directions when all the facts were admitted regarding the eligibility of the respondent no 1 and his possessing of the requisite qualifications remand to the authorities would have been merely a ritual and ceremonial keeping in mind the lapses attributable to the commission which had failed to take appropriate action despite recommendation made in favour of the respondent no 1 the learned single judge as also the division bench of the high court felt it necessary to declare the respondent no 1 promoter with effect from 121985 we do not find any illegality or error of jurisdiction learned counsel appearing for the appellants were apprehensive that if the impugned judgment is not set aside it may become precedent and in other cases pertaining to the university such directions may be issued in future also preventing the authorities and the state government from exercising their statutory powers the apprehension is misconceived and without any substance to allay even such apprehension we deem it appropriate to clarify that the impugned judgment has been passed under peculiar circumstances of the case and is no precedent with respect to the subject regarding which the appellants have conceived an apprehensionemphasis supplied\n",
      "38  apart from the fact that in peculiar circumstances a positive direction was issued by this court and it was stated that the decision is no precedent with respect to the subject in our opinion in the present case the second stage did not arise at all as we have held that even under the policy in force in 2000 the appellant bank was wholly right and fully justified in declining the prayer of the widow of deceased employee in rejecting her prayer for extending benefit of appointment on compassionate ground the orders passed by both the courts are therefore liable to be set aside on that ground alone\n",
      "39  for the aforesaid reasons the appeal is allowed the order passed by the single judge and confirmed by the division bench of the high court is set aside and the writ petition filed by the widow of deceased employee of the state bank for getting an appointment as dependent of deceased employee on compassionate ground is ordered to be dismissed\n",

      "2  bharat gold mines ltd respondent no 1 is a govt undertaking at kolar gold fields in karnataka where the appellant was appointed as a security officer on 31101983 on 2nd of june 1985 a raid was conducted by the superintendent of police at the house of the appellant from where a mining sponge gold ball weighing 45 grams and 1276 grams of gold bearing sand were recovered thereafter on the same day a first information report was lodged at the police station and a criminal case was registered against the appellant who was placed under suspension on 361985 the next day namely on 4th of june 1985 a chargesheet was issued proposing a regular departmental inquiry with regard to the recovery of the above articles from his house on 11th of june 1985 the appellant made a representation to the disciplinary authority denying the allegations made against him in the charge sheet and pleaded that the entire episode was a concoction he prayed that the departmental proceedings initiated against him may be dropped or may in the alternative be postponed till the conclusion of the criminal proceedings against him on the basis of the first information report lodged against him at the police station on 261985 the representation was rejected on 1961985 and the appellant was informed that the disciplinary proceedings would be held against him on 171985\n",
      "3  in the meantime the appellant filed writ petition no 10842 of 1985 in the karnataka high court for a direction to restrain the respondents from proceeding with the disciplinary inquiry till the conclusion of the criminal case as the appellants defence was likely to be prejudiced this writ petition was disposed of by the high court on 1981985 and a direction was issued to the respondents to consider and dispose of the appellants appeal filed against the order of suspension but liberty was given to the respondents to defer the disciplinary proceedings if it was found expedient so to do the respondents did not defer the departmental proceedings and continued the proceedings which the appellant could not attend on account of his illhealth and financial difficulties which compelled him to shift to his hometown in kerala the respondents were informed by a number of letters supported by medical certificates about his illness with a request for staying the departmental proceedings and await the result of the criminal case but the inquiry officer rejected the request and recorded his findings on 1051986 holding the appellant guilty these findings were accepted by the disciplinary authority and by order dated 7th june 1986 the appellant was dismissed from service\n",
      "4  on 3rd of february 1987 judgment in the criminal case was pronounced and the appellant was acquitted with the categorical findings that the prosecution had failed to establish its case this judgment was communicated by the appellant to the respondents on 1221987 with a request that he may be reinstated but respondents by their letter dated 331987 rejected the request on the ground that the appellant had already been dismissed from service on the completion of the departmental inquiry which was conducted independently of the criminal case and therefore the judgment passed by the magistrate was of no consequence\n",
      "5  the order of dismissal passed by the respondents was challenged in a departmental appeal which was rejected by the appellate authority on 2271987\n",
      "6 it was at this stage that the appellant approached the high court through a writ petition uart 226 of the constitution challenging the validity of the order of dismissal on various grounds including that the departmental proceedings based on the same set of facts on which the criminal case was launched against him ought to have been stayed awaiting the result of the criminal case it was also pointed out that since the appellant had already been acquitted and the prosecution case against the appellant based on the raid and recovery which also constituted the basis of the departmental proceedings had not been found to be true he was entitled to be reinstated in service\n",
      "7  the writ petition was allowed by a single judge of the high court on 2691995 with the finding that the departmental proceedings and the criminal case being based on the same set of facts departmental proceedings should have been stayed till the result of the criminal case and since in the criminal case the appellant had already been acquitted and the prosecution case was not found established the respondents could not legally refuse reinstatement or the consequent backwages to the appellant while directing reinstatement of the appellant the high court gave liberty to respondents to initiate fresh proceedings against the appellant after perusing the judgment passed in the criminal case\n",
      "8  this judgment was however set aside by the division bench on 17th september 1997 in a letters patent appeal filed by the respondents it is this judgment which is under appeal before us learned counsel for the appellant has contended that the respondents having themselves launched the criminal case were not justified in proceeding with the departmental inquiry which was based on the same set of facts and ought to have stayed those proceedings till the conclusion of the criminal case since the basis of action in both the cases namely the departmental proceedings and the criminal case was the raid conducted by the superintendent of police at the residence of the appellant from where a recovery was also allegedly made the departmental proceedings were liable to be stayed as the facts and the evidence in both the proceedings were common in these circumstances the appellant it is contended was justified in requesting the respondents to stay the departmental proceedings and on the refusal of the respondents to stay the proceedings the appellant was justified in not participating in those proceedings as his defence was likely to be prejudiced it is also contended that the appellant was ill and for that reason also the departmental proceedings ought to have been stayed till he had completely recovered it is also submitted that the appellant who had been placed under suspension was not being paid the subsistence allowance with the result that he fell into serious financial difficulties and could not undertake any journey from his hometown in kerala to kolar gold fields in karnataka for participating in the departmental proceedings the division bench it is contended was not justified in interfering with the judgment passed by the single judge who had found it as a positive fact that the departmental proceedings and the criminal case were based on the same set of facts and the evidence in both the cases was common\n",
      "9  learned counsel for the respondents has however contended that the respondents were under no obligation to stay the departmental proceedings and await the result of the criminal case as there was no legal bar in holding the departmental proceedings simultaneously with the proceedings in the criminal case particularly as the level of proof in both the proceedings is different and the purpose with which the departmental proceedings are conducted is also not identical with the purpose with which the criminal case is prosecuted for an offence committed by the employee this question as observed earlier is of a perennial nature and has arisen more often than not in spite of the judicial pronouncements specially by this court having settled the question and provided the answer still the problem is raised either by the employer or by the employee in one or the other form in the instant case the order of dismissal had already been passed before the decision of the criminal case which ultimately resulted in the acquittal of the appellant whether the acquittal coupled with other circumstances specially exparte proceedings of the case will have the effect of vitiating the departmental proccedings or the order of dismissal passed against the appellant is the question which is to be considered in this appeal\n",
      "10  as we shall presently see there is a consensus of judicial opinion amongst the high courts whose decisions we do not intend to refer in this case and the various pronouncements of this court which shall be copiously referred to on the basic principle that proceedings in a criminal case and the departmental proceedings can proceed simultaneously with a little exception as we understand the basis for this proposition is that proceedings in a criminal case and the departmental proceedings operate in distinct and different jurisdictional areas whereas in the departmental proceedings where a charge relating to misconduct is being investigated the factors operating in the mind of the disciplinary authority may be many such as enforcement of discipline or to investigate the level of integrity of the delinquent or the other staff the standard of proof required in the those proceedings is also different than that required in a criminal case while in the departmental proceedings the standard of proof is one of preponderance of the probabilities in a criminal case the charge has to be proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubts the little exception may be where the departmental procedings and the criminal case are based on the same set of facts and the evidence in both the proceedings is common without there being a variance\n",

      "there is yet another point which remains to be considered the industrial tribunal appears to have taken the view that since criminal proceedings had been started against raghavan the domestic enquiry should have been stayed pending the final disposal of the said criminal proceedings as this court has held in the delhi cloth and general mills ltd vs kushal bhan 1959 indlaw sc 140 it is desirable that if the incident giving rise to a charge framed against a workman in a domestic enquiry is being tried in a criminal court the employer should stay the domestic enquiry pending the final disposal of the criminal case\n",

      "the issue in the disciplinary proceedings is whether the employee is guilty of the charges on which it is proposed to take action against him the same issue may arise for decision in a civil or criminal proceeding pending in a court but the pendency of the court proceeding does not bar the taking of disciplinary action the power of taking such action is vested in the disciplinary authority the civil or criminal court has no such power the initiation and continuation of disciplinary proceedings in good faith is not calculated to obstruct or interfere with the course of justice in the pending court proceeding\n",
      "the employee is free to move the court for an order restraining the continuance of the disciplinary proceedings if he obtains a stay order a wilful violation of the order would of course amount to contempt of court in the absence of a stay order the disciplinary authority is free to exercise its lawful powers\n",
      "14  these decisions indicate that though it would not be wrong in conducting two parallel proceedings one by way of disciplinary action and the other in the criminal court still it would be desirable to stay the domestic inquiry if the incident giving rise to a charge framed against the employee in a domestic inquiry is being tried in a criminal court the case law was reviewed by this court in kusheshwar dubey vs ms bharat coking coal ltd  ors 1988 4 scc 319  1988 supp 2 scr 821  air 1988 sc 2118 1988 indlaw sc 496 and it was laid down as under \n",
      "the view expressed in the three cases of this court seem to support the position that while there could be no legal bar for simultaneous proceedings being taken yet there may be cases where it would be appropriate to defer disciplinary proceedings awaiting disposal of the criminal case in the latter class of cases it would be open to the delinquent employee to seek such an order of stay or injunction from the court whether in the facts and circumstances of particular case there should or should not be such simultaneity of the proceedings would then receive judicial consideration and the court will decide in the given circumstances of particular case as to whether the disciplinary proceedings should be interdicted pending criminal trial as we have already stated that it is neither possible nor advisable to evolve a hard and fast straitjacket formula valid for all cases and of general application without regard to the particularities of the individual situation for the disposal of the present case we do not think it necessary to say anything more particularly when we do not intend to lay down any general guideline\n",
      "15  the court further observed as under  in the instant case the criminal action and the disciplinary proceedings are grounded upon the same set of facts we are of the view that the disciplinary proceedings should have been stayed and the high court was not right in interfering with the trial courts order of injunction which had been affirmed in appeal\n",

      "so far the first point is concerned namely whether the disciplinary proceedings could have been continued in the face of the acquittal of the appellant in the criminal case the plea has no substance whatsoever and does not merit a detailed consideration the nature and scope of a criminal case are very different from those of a departmental disciplinary proceeding and an order of acquittal therefore cannot conclude the departmental proceedings besides the tribunal has pointed out that the acts which led to the initiation of the departmenal disciplinary proceeding were not exactly the same which were the subject matter of the criminal case emphasis supplied\n",

      "it would be evident from the above decisions that each of them starts with the indisputable proposition that there is no legal bar for both proceedings to go on simultaneously and then say that in certain situation it may not be desirable advisable or appropriate to proceed with the disciplinary enquiry when a criminal case is pending on identical charge the staying of disciplinary proceedings it is emphasised is a matter to be determined having regard to the facts and circumstances of a given case and that no hard and fast rules can be enunciated in that behalf the only ground suggested in the above decisions as constituting a valid ground for staying the disciplinary proceedings is that the defence of the employee in the criminal case may not be prejudiced this ground has however been hedged in by providing further that this may be done in cases of grave nature involving questions of fact and law in our respectful opinion it means that not only the charges must be grave but that the case must involve complicated questions of law and fact moreover advisability desirability or propriety as the case may be has to be determined in each case taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case the ground indicated in dcm air 1960 sc 806 1959 indlaw sc 140 and tata oil mills air 1965 sc 155 1964 indlaw sc 139 is also not an invariable rule\n",
      "it is only a factor which will go into the scales while judging the advisability or desirability of staying the disciplinary proceedings one of the contending considerations is that the disciplinary enquiry cannot be  and should not be  delayed unduly so far as criminal cases are concerned it is well known that they drag on endlessly where high officials or persons are involved they get bogged down on one or the other ground they hardly ever reach a prompt conclusion that is the reality in spite of repeated advice and admonitions from this court and the high courts if a criminal case is unduly delayed that may itself be a good ground for going ahead with the disciplinary enquiry even where the disciplinary proceedings are held over at an earlier stage the interests of administration and good government demand that these proceedings are concluded expeditiously it must be remembered that interests of administration demand that undesirable elements are thrown out and any charge of misdemeanour is inquired into promptly the disciplinary proceedings are meant not really to punish the guilty but to keep the administrative machinery unsullied by getting rid of bad elements the interest of the delinquent officer also lies in a prompt conclusion of the disciplinary proceedings if he is not guilty of the charges his honour should be vindicated at the earlist possible moment and if he is guilty he should be dealt with promptly according to law it is not also in the interest of administration that persons accused of serious misdemeanour should be continued in office indefinitely ie for long periods awaiting the result of criminal proceedings it is not in the interest of administration it only serves the interest of the guilty and dishonest while it is not possible to enumerate the various factors for and against the stay of disciplinary proceedings we found it necesasry to emphasise some of the important considerations in view of the fact that very often the disciplinary proceedings are being stayed for long periods pending criminal proceedings stay of disciplinary proceedings cannot be and should not be a matter of course all the relevant factors for and against should be weighed and a decision taken keeping in view of the various principles laid down in the decisions referred to above\n",
      "17 this decision has gone two steps further to the earlier decisions by providing \n",
      "1 the advisability desirability or propriety of staying the departmental proceedings go into the scales while judging the advisability or desirability of staying the disciplinary proceedings merely as one of the factors which cannot be considered in isolation of other circumstances of the case but the charges in the criminal case must in any case be of a grave and serious nature involving complicated questions of fact and law\n",
      "2 one of the contending considerations would be that the disciplinary enquiry cannot  and should not be  delayed unduly if the criminal case is unduly delayed that may itself be a good ground for going ahead with the disciplinary enquiry even though the disciplinary proceedings were held over at an earlier stage it would not be in the interests of administration that persons accused of serious misdemeanour should be continued in office indefinitely awaiting the result of criminal proceedings\n",

      "18 the conclusions which are deducible from various decisions of this court referred to above are \n",
      "i departmental proceedings and proceedings in a criminal case can proceed simultaneously as there is no bar in their being conducted simultaneously though separately\n",
      "ii if the departmental proceedings and the criminal case are based on identical and similar set of facts and the charge in the criminal case against the delinquent employee is of a grave nature which involves complicated questions of law and fact it would be desirable to stay the departmental proceedings till the conclusion of the criminal case\n",
      "iii whether the nature of a charge in a criminal case is grave and whether complicated questions of fact and law are involved in that case will depend upon the nature of offence the nature of the case launched against the employee on the basis of evidence and material collected against him during investigation or as reflected in the charge sheet\n",
      "iv the factors mentioned at ii and iii above cannot be considered in isolation to stay the departmental proceedings but due regard has to be given to the fact that the departmental proceedings cannot be unduly delayed\n",
      "v if the criminal case does not proceed or its disposal is being unduly delayed the departmental proceedings even if they were stayed on account of the pendency of the criminal case can be resumed and proceeded with so as to conclude them at an early date so that if the employee is found not guilty his honour may be vindicated and in case he is found guilty administration may get rid of him at the earliest\n",
      "19 in the instant case the superintendent of police had raided the residential premises of the appellant and had recovered a mining sponge gold ball weighing 45 grams and 1276 grams of gold bearing sand it was on this basis that criminal case was launched against him on the same set of facts constituting the raid and recovery departmental proceedings were initiated against the apellant as the recovery was treated to be a misconduct on the service of the charge sheet the appellant raised an objection that the departmental proceedings may be stayed as the basis of these proceedings was the raid conducted at his residence on which basis a criminal case had already been launched against him he requested that the decision of the criminal case may be awaited but his request was turned down the request made a second time for that purpose also met the same fate when the appellant approached the high court liberty was given to the respondents to stay the departmental proceedings if they considered it appropriate but they were directed to dispose of the appellants appeal against the order by which he was placed under suspension the order of the high court had no effect on the respondents and they decided to continue with the departmental proceedings which could not be attended by the appellant as he informed the inquiry officer that he was ill his request for adjournment of the departmental proceedings on that ground was not acceded to and the proceedings continued exparte against him he was ultimately found guilty of the charges and was dismissed from service\n",
      "learned counsel for the appellant also contended that during the period of suspension the respondents had not paid him the subsistence allowance with the result that he could not undertake a journey from his hometown in kerala to kolar gold fields in karnataka where the departmental proceedings were being held this plea has not been accepted by the high court on the ground that it was not raised before the inquiry officer and it was not pleaded before him that it was on account of non payment of subsistence allowance that the appellant could not go to kolar gold fields for participating in the disciplinary proceedings\n",
      "20 before us it is not disputed on behalf of the respondents nor was it disputed by them before the high court that subsistence allowance was not paid to the appellant while the proceedings against him were being conducted at the departmental level\n",
      "to place an employee under suspension is an unqualified right of the employer this right is conceded to the employer in service jurisprudence everywhere it has even received statutory recognition under service rules framed by various authorities including govt of india and the state governments see for example rule 10 of central civil services classification control  appeal rules even under the general clauses act this right is conceded to the employer by s 16 which inter alia provides that power to appoint includes power to suspend or dismiss\n",
      "21 the order of suspension does not put an end to an employees service and he continues to be a member of the service though he is not permitted to work and is paid only subsistence allowance which is less than his salary see state of mp vs state of maharashtra 1977 2 scr 555  1977 2 scc 288  air 1977 sc 1466 1977 indlaw sc 192\n",
      "service rules also usually provide for payment of salary at a reduced rate during the period of suspension see fundamental rule 53 this constitutes the subsistence allowance if there is no provision in the rules applicable to a particular class of service for payment of salary at a reduced rate the employer would be liable to pay full salary even during the period of suspension\n",
      "22 exercise of right to suspend an employee may be justified on facts of a particular case instances however are not rare where officers have been found to be afflicted by suspension syndrome and the employees have been found to be placed under suspension just for nothing it is their irritability rather than the employees trivial lapse which has often resulted in suspension suspension notwithstanding nonpayment of subsistence allowance is an inhuman act which has an unpropitious effect on the life of an employee when the employee is placed under suspension he is demobilised and the salary is also paid to him at a reduced rate under the nick name of subsistence allowance so that the employee may sustain himself this court in op gupta vs union of india  ors 1987 4 scc 328 1987 indlaw sc 28178 made the following observations with regard to subsistence allowance \n",
      "an order of suspension of a government servant does not put an end to his service under the government he continues to be a member of the service in spite of the order of suspension the real effect of suspension as explained by this court in khem chand v union of india 1957 indlaw sc 12 is that he continues to be a member of the government service but is not permitted to work and further during the period of suspension he is paid only some allowance  generally called subsistence allowance  which is normally less than the salary instead of the pay and allowances he would have been entitled to if he had not been suspended there is no doubt that an order of suspension unless the departmental inquiry is concluded within a reasonable time affects a government servant injuriously the very expression subsistence allowance has an undeniable penal significance the dictionary meaning of the word subsist as given in shorter oxford english dictionary volii at p 2171 is to remain alive as on food to continue to exist subsistence means  means of supporting life especially a minimum livelihood emphasis supplied\n",
      "23 if therefore even that amount is not paid then the very object of paying the reduced salary to the employee during the period of suspension would be frustrated the act of nonpayment of subsistence allowance can be likened to slowpoisoning as the employee if not permitted to sustain himself on account of nonpayment of subsistence allowance would gradually starve himself to death\n",
      "on joining govt service a person does not mortgage or barter away his basic rights as a human being including his fundamental rights in favour of the govt the govt only because it has the power to appoint does not become the master of the body and soul of the employee the govt by providing job opportunities to its citizens only fulfils its obligations under the constitution including the directive principles of the state policy the employee on taking up an employment only agrees to subject himself to the regulatory measures concerning his service his association with the government or any other employer like instrumentalities of the govt or statutory or autonomous corporations etc is regulated by the terms of contract of service or service rules made by the central or the state govt under the proviso to art 309 of the constitution or other statutory rules including certified standing orders the fundamental rights including the right to life uart 21 of the constitution or the basic human rights are not surrendered by the employee the provision for payment of subsistence allowance made in the service rules only ensures nonviolation of the right to life of the employee that was the reason why this court in state of maharashtra vs chanderbhan 19833 scr 337  1983 3 scc 387  air 1983 sc 803 1983 indlaw sc 110 struck down a service rule which provided for payment of a nominal amount of rupee one as subsistence allowance to an employee placed under suspension this decision was followed in fakirbhai fulabhai solanki vs presiding officer  anr 1986 3 scc 131  19862 scr 1059  air 1986 sc 1168 1986 indlaw sc 594 and it was held in that case that if an employee could not attend the departmental proceedings on account of financial stringencies caused by nonpayment of subsistence allowance and thereby could not undertake a journey away from his home to attend the departmental proceedings the order of punishment including the whole proceedings would stand vitiated for this purpose reliance was also placed on an earlier decision in ghanshyam dass shrivastva vs state of madhya pradesh 1973 1 scc 656  air 1973 sc 1183 1973 indlaw sc 13\n",
      "24 the question whether the appellant was unable to go to kolar gold fields to participate in the inquiry proceedings on account of nonpayment of subsistence allowance may not have been raised before the inquiry officer but it was positively raised before the high court and has also been raised before us since it is not disputed that the subsistence allowance was not paid to the appellant during the pendency of the departmental proceedings we have to take strong notice of it particularly as it is not suggested by the respondents that the appellant had any other source of income\n",
      "since in the instant case the appellant was not provided any subsistence allowance during the period of suspension and the adjournment prayed for by him on account of his illness duly supported by medical certificates was refused resulting in exparte proceedings against him we are of the opinion that the appellant has been punished in total violation of the principles of natural justice and he was literally not afforded any opportunity of hearing moreover as pleaded by the appellant before the high court as also before us that on account of his penury occasioned by nonpayment of subsistence allowance he could not undertake a journey to attend the disciplinary proceedings the findings recorded by the inquiry officer at such proceedings which were held exparte stand vitiated\n",
      "25 there is yet another reason for discarding the whole of the case of the respondents as pointed out earlier the criminal case as also the departmental proceedings were based on identical set of facts namely the raid conducted at the appellants residence and recovery of incriminating articles therefrom the findings recorded by the inquiry officer a copy of which has been placed before us indicate that the charges framed against the appellant were sought to be proved by police officers and panch witnesses who had raided the house of the appellant and had effected recovery they were the only witnesses examined by the inquiry officer and the inquiry officer relying upon their statements came to the conclusion that the charges were established against the appellant the same witnesses were examined in the criminal case but the court on a consideration of the entire evidence came to the conclusion that no search was conducted nor was any recovery made from the residence of the appellant the whole case of the prosecution was thrown out and the appellant was acquitted in this situation therefore where the appellant is acquitted by a judicial pronouncement with the finding that the raid and recovery at the residence of the appellant were not proved it would be unjust unfair and rather oppressive to allow the findings recorded at the ex parte departmental proceedings to stand\n",
      "since the facts and the evidence in both the proceedings namely the departmental proceedings and the criminal case were the same without there being any iota of difference the distinction which is usually drawn as between the departmental proceedings and the criminal case on the basis of approach and burden of proof would not be applicable to the instant case\n",
      "26 for the reasons stated above the appeal is allowed the impugned judgment passed by the division bench of the high court is set aside and that of the learned single judge in so far as it purports to allow the writ petition is upheld the learned single judge has also given liberty to the respondents to initiate fresh disciplinary proceedings in the peculiar citcumstances of the case specially having regard to the fact that the appellant is undergoing this agony since 1985 despite having been acquitted by the criminal court in 1987 we would not direct any fresh departmental inquiry to be instituted against him on the same set of facts the appellant shall be reinstated forthwith on the post of security officer and shall also be paid entire arrears of salary together with all allowances from the date of suspension till his reinstatement within three months the appellant would also be entitled to his cost which is quantified as rs15000\n",

      "3 the government of india deptt of personnel  training issued an office memorandum no 22011179 estt a dated january 30 1982 on the subject of promotion of officers in whose cases the sealed cover procedure had been followed but against whom disciplinarycourt proceedings were pending for a long time the memorandum stated that according to the existing instructions cases of officers \n",

      "b against whom disciplinary proceedings are pending or a decision has been taken by the competent disciplinary authority to initiate disciplinary proceedings or\n",
      "c against whom prosecution has been launched in a court of law or sanction for prosecution has been issued are considered for promotion by the departmental promotion committee hereinafter referred to as the dpc at the appropriate time but the findings of the committee are kept in a sealed cover to be opened after the conclusion of the disciplinarycourt proceedings\n",
      "4 while the findings are kept in the sealed cover the vacancy which might have gone to the officer concerned is filled only on an officiating basis if on the conclusion of the departmentalcourt proceedings the officer concerned is completely exonerated and where he is under suspension it is also held that the suspension waswholly unjustified the sealed cover is opened and the recommendations of the dpc are acted upon if the officer could have been promoted earlier he is promoted to the post which is filled on an officiating basis the officiating arrangement being terminated on his promotion the officer gets the benefit of seniority and fixation of pay on a notional basis with reference to the date on which he would have been promoted in the normal course but for the pending disciplinary court proceedings\n",
      "however no arrears of salary are paid in respect of the period prior to the date of actual promotion the memorandum goes on to state further that it was noticed that sometimes the cases in the courts or the departmental proceedings take unduly long time to come to a conclusion and the officers undergo considerable hardship even where it is not intended to deprive them of promotion for such a long time\n",
      "5 the government therefore in consultation with the union public service commission examined how the hardship caused to the government servant in such circumstances can be mitigated and has laid down the following procedure in such cases\n",
      "3 ia it may be ascertained whether there is any departmental disciplinaryproceedings or any case in a court of law pending against the individual under consideration or b there is a primafacie case on the basis of which a decision has been taken to proceed against the official either departmentally or in a court of law\n",
      "ii the facts may be brought to the notice of the departmental promotion committee who may then assess the suitability of the officials for promotion to the next gradepost and for the purpose of this assessment the dpc shall not take into consideration the fact of the pending cases against the official in case an official is found unfit for promotion on the basis of his record without taking into consideration the cases pending against him the findings of the dpc shall be recorded in the proceedings in respect of any other kind of assessment the grading awarded by the dpc may be kept in a sealed cover\n",
      "iii after the findings are kept in a sealed cover by the departmental promotion committee subsequent dpcs if any held after the first dpc during the period the disciplinarycourt proceedings may be pending will also consider the officers case and record their findings which will again be kept in sealed cover in the above manner\n",
      "in the normal course on the conclusion of the disciplinarycourt proceedings the sealed cover or covers may be opened and in case the officer is completely exonerated ie no statutory penalty including that of censure is imposed the earliest possible date of his promotion but for the pendency of the disciplinarycourt proceedings against him may be determined with reference to the positions assigned to him in the findings in the sealed covercovers and with reference to the date of promotion of his next junior on the basis of such position the officer concerned may then be promoted if necessary by reverting the junior most officiating person and he may be given a notional promotion from the date he would have been promoted as determined in the manner indicated above but no arrears of pay shall be payable to him for the period of notional promotion proceeding the date of actual promotion\n",
      "if any penalty is imposed on the officer as a result of the disciplinary proceedings or if he is found guilty in the court proceedings against him the findings in the sealed covercovers shall not be acted upon the officers case for promotion may be considered in the usual manner by the next dpc which meets in the normal course after the conclusion of the disciplinarycourt proceedings the existing instructions provide that in a case where departmental disciplinary proceedings have been held under the relevant disciplinary rules warning should not be issued as a result of such proceedings if it is found as a result of the proceedings that some blame attaches to the officer then the penalty of censure at least should be imposed this may be kept in view so that no occasion arises for any doubt on the point whether or not an officer has been completely exonerated in disciplinary proceedings held against him\n",
      "6 clause iv of para 3 of the memorandum then lays down the procedure for ad hoc appointment of the concerned officer when the disciplinarycourt proceedings are not concluded even after the expiry of two years from the date of the dpc which first considered him for promotion and whose findings are kept in the sealed cover provided however that the officer is not under suspension it is not necessary to reproduce that clause in extenso here suffice it to say that the memorandum urges that in making the ad hoc promotion in such cases his case should be placed before the dpc which is held after the expiry of the said period of two years and the ad hoc promotion has to be made on the basis of the totality of the record of service etc\n",
      "7 para 4 of the memorandum states that if the officer concerned is acquitted in the court proceedings on the merits of the case or exonerated in departmental disciplinary proceedings the ad hoc promotion already made may be confirmed and the promotion treated as a regular one from the date of the ad hoc promotion with all attendant benefits in such cases the sealed cover may be opened and the official may be assigned his place in the seniority list as he would have got in accordance with the recommendation of the dpc\n",
      "8 paras 5 6 and 7 of the memorandum then read as follows\n",
      "5 where the acquittal in a court case is not on merits but purely on technical grounds and the government either proposes to take the matter to a higher court or to proceed against the officer departmentally the appointing authority may review whether the adhoc promotion should be continued\n",
      "6 where the acquittal by court is on technical grounds if the government does not propose to go in appeal to a higher court or to take further departmental action action should be taken in the same manner as if the officer had been acquitted by the court on merits\n",
      "7 if the officer concerned is not acquittedexonerated in the court proceedings or the departmental proceedings the adhoc promotion already granted should be brought to an end by the issue of the further order contemplated in the order of adhoc promotion  and the officer concerned reverted to the post from which he was promoted on adhoc basis after such reversion the officer may be considered for future promotion in the usual course by the next dpc\n",
      "9 to bring the record uptodate it may be pointed out that in view of the decision of this court in union of india  anr v tajinder singh 1986 2 scale 860 1986 indlaw sc 507 decided on september 26 1986 the government of india in the deptt of personnel  training issued another office memorandum no 22011286 estt a dated january 12 1988 in supersession of all the earlier instructions on the subject including the office memorandum dated 30th january 1982 referred to above there is no difference in the instructions contained in this and the earlier aforesaid memorandum of january 30 1982 except that this memorandum provides in paragraph 4 for a sixmonthly review of the pending proceedings against the government servant where the proceedings are still at the stage of investigation and if as a result of the review the appointing authority comes to the conclusion on the basis of material and evidence collected in the investigation till that time that there is no prima facie case in initiating disciplinary action or sanctioning prosecution the sealed cover is directed to be opened and the employee is directed to be given his due promotion with reference to the position assigned to him by the dpc a further guideline contained in this memorandum is that the same sealed cover procedure is to be applied where a government servant is recommended for promotion by the dpc but before he is actually promoted he is either placed under suspension or disciplinary proceedings are taken against him or decision has been taken to initiate the proceedings or criminal prosecution is launched or sanction for such prosecution has been issued or decision to accord such sanction is taken these differences in the two memoranda have no bearing on the questions to be answered\n",
      "10 on the first question viz as to when for the purposes of the sealed cover procedure the disciplinarycriminal proceedings can be said to have commenced the full bench of the tribunal has held that it is only when a chargememo in a disciplinary proceedings or a charge sheet in a criminal prosecution is issued to the employee that it can be said that the departmental proceedingscriminal prosecution is initiated against the employee the sealed cover procedure is to be resorted to only after the chargememochargesheet is issued the pendency of preliminary investigation prior to that stage will not be sufficient to enable the authorities to adopt the sealed cover procedure we are in agreement with the tribunal on this point the contention advanced by the learned counsel for the appellantauthorities that when there are serious allegations and it takes time to collect necessary evidence to prepare and issue chargememochargesheet it would not be in the interest of the purity of administration to reward the employee with a promotion increment etc does not impress us the acceptance of this contention would result in injustice to the employees in manycases as has been the experience so far the preliminary investigations take an inordinately long time and particularly when they are initiated at the instance of the interested persons they are kept pending deliberately many times they never result in the issue of any chargememocharge sheet if the allegations are serious and the authorities are keen in investigating them ordinarily it slould not take much time to collect the relevant evidence and finalise the charges what is further if the charges are that serious the authorities have the power to suspend the employee under the relevant rules and the suspension by itself permits a resort to the sealed cover procedure the authorities thus are not without a remedy it was then contended on behalf of the authorities that conclusions nos 1 and 4 of the full bench of the tribunal are inconsistent with each other those conclusions are as follows\n",
      "1 consideration for promotion selection grade crossing the efficiency bar or higher scale of pay cannot be withheld merely on the ground of pendency of disciplinary or criminal proceedings against an official\n",
      "3 \n",
      "4 the sealed cover procedure can be resorted only after a charge memo is served on the concerned official or the charge sheet filed before the criminal court and not before\n",
      "11 there is no doubt that there is a seeming contradiction between the two conclusions but read harmoniously and that is what the full bench has intended the two conclusions can be reconciled with each other the conclusion no 1 should be read to mean that the promotion etc cannot be withheld merely because some disciplinarycriminal proceedings are pending against the employee to deny the said benefit they must be at the relevant time pending at the stage when chargememochargesheet has already been issued to the employee thus read there is no inconsistency in the two conclusions\n",
      "12 we therefore repel the challenge of the appellant authorities to the said finding of the full bench of the tribunal\n",
      "13 the full bench of the tribunal while considering the earlier memorandum dated 30th january 1982 has among other things held that the portion of paragraph 2 of the memorandum which says but no arrears are allowed in respect of the period prior to the date of the actual promotion is violative of articles 14 and 16 of the constitution because withholding of salary of the promotional post for the perked during which the promotion has been withheld while giving other benefits is discriminatory when compared with other employees who are not at the verge of promotion when the disciplinary proceedings  were initiated against them\n",
      "14 the tribunal has therefore directed that on exoneration full salary should be paid to such employee which he would have on promotion if he had not been subjected to disciplinary proceedings we are afraid that the tribunals reference to paragraph 2 of the memorandum is incorrect paragraph 2 only recites the state of affairs as existed on january 30 1982 and the portion of the memorandum which deals with the relevant point is the last sentence of the first subparagraph after clause iii of paragraph 3 of the memorandum which is reproduced above that sentence reads as follows\n",
      "but no arrears of pay shall be payable to him for the period of notional promotion preceding the date of actual promotion\n",
      "15 this sentence is preceded by the observation that when the employee is completely exonerated on the conclusion of the disciplinarycourt proceedings that is when no statutory penalty including that of censure is imposed he is to be given a notional promotion from the date he would have been promoted as determined by the departmental promotion committee this direction in the memorandum has also to be read along with the other direction which follows in the next subparagraph and which states that if it is found as a result of the proceedings that some blame attaches to the officer then the penalty of censure at least should be imposed this direction is in supersession of the earlier instructions which provided that in a case where departmental disciplinary proceedings have been held warning should not be issued as a result of such proceedings\n",
      "16 there is no doubt that when an employee is completely exonerated and is not visited with the penalty even of censure indicating thereby that he was not blame worthy in the least he should not be deprived of any benefits including the salary of the promotional post it was urged on behalf of the appellantauthorities in all these cases that a person is not entitled to the salary of the post unless he assumes charge of the same they relied on fr 171 of the fundamental rules and supplementary rules which reads as follows\n",
      "fr 171 subject to any exceptions specifically made in these rules and to the provision of subrule 2 an officer shall begin to draw the pay and allowances attached to his tenure of a post with effect from the date when he assumes the duties of that post and shall cease to draw them as soon as he ceases to discharge those duties\n",
      "provided that an officer who is absent from duty without any authority shall not be entitled to any pay and allowances during the period of such absence\n",
      "17 it was further contended on their behalf that the normal rule is no work no pay hence a person cannot be allowed to draw the benefits of a post the duties of which he has not discharged to allow him to do so is against the elementary rule that a person is to be paid only for the work he has done and not for the work he has not done as against this it was pointed out on behalf of the concerned employees that on many occasions even frivolous proceedings are instituted at the instance of interested persons sometimes with a specific object of denying the promotion due and the employee concerned is made to suffer both mental agony and privations which are multiplied when he is also placed under suspension when therefore at the end of such sufferings he comes out with a clean bill he has to be restored to all the benefits from which he was kept away unjustly\n",
      "18 we are not much impressed by the contentions advanced on behalf of the authorities the normal rule of no work no pay is not applicable to cases such as the present one where the employee although he is willing to work is kept away from work by the authorities for no fault of his this is not a case where the employee remains away from work for his own reasons although the work is offered to him it is for this reason that fr 171 will also be inapplicable to such cases\n",
      "19 we are therefore broadly in agreement with the finding of the tribunal that when an employee is completely exonerated meaning thereby that he is not found blameworthy in the least and is not visited with the penalty even of censure he has to be given the benefit of the salary of the higher post along with the other benefits from the date on which he would have normally been promoted but for the disciplinary criminal proceedings\n",
      "however there may be cases where the proceedings whether disciplinary or criminal are for example delayed at the instance of the employee or the clearance in the disciplinary proceedings or acquittal in the criminal proceedings is with benefit of doubt or on account of nonavailability of evidence due to the acts attributable to the employee etc in such circumstances the concerned authorities must be vested with the power to decide whether the employee at all deserves any salary for the intervening period and if he does the extent to which he deserves it life being complex it is not possible to anticipate and enumerate exhaustively all the circumstances under which such consideration may become necessary to ignore however such circumstances when they exist and lay down an inflexible rule that in every case when an employee is exonerated in disciplinary criminal proceedings he should be entitled to all salary for the intervening period is to undermine discipline in the administration and jeopardise public interests we are therefore unable to agree with the tribunal that to deny the salary to an employee would in all circumstances be illegal\n",
      "20 while therefore we do not approve of the said last sentence in the first subparagraph after clause iii of paragraph 3 of the said memorandum viz but no arrears of pay shall be payable to him for the period of notional promotion preceding the date of actual promotion we direct that in place of the said sentence the following sentence be read in the memorandum\n",
      "however whether the officer concerned will be entitled to any arrears of pay for the period of notional promotion preceding the date of actual promotion and if so to what extent will be decided by the concerned authority by taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the disciplinary proceedingcriminal prosecution where the authority denies arrears of salary or part of it it will record its reasons for doing so\n",
      "21 to this extent we set aside the conclusion of the tribunal on the said point the tribunal has also struck down the following portion in the second subparagraph after clause iii of paragraph 3 of the memorandum which reads as follows\n",
      "if any penalty is imposed on the officer as a result of the disciplinary proceedings or if he is found guilty in the court proceedings against him the findings in the sealed covercovers shall not be acted upon and has directed that if the proceedings result in a penalty the person concerned should be considered for promotion in a review dpc as on the original date in the light of the results of the scaled cover as also the imposition of penalty and his claim for promotion cannot be deferred for the subsequent dpcs as provided in the instructions it may be pointed out that the said subparagraph directs that the officers case for promotion may be considered in the usual manner by the next dpc which meets in the normal course after the conclusion of the disciplinarycourt proceedings\n",
      "the tribunal has given the direction in question on the ground that such deferment of the claim for promotion to the subsequent dpcs amounts to a double penalty\n",
      "22 according to the tribunal it not only violates articles 14 and 16 of the constitution compared with other employees who are not at the verge of promotion when the disciplinary proceedings are initiated against them but also offends the rule against double leopardy contained in article 202 of the constitution the tribunal has therefore held that when an employee is visited with a penalty as a result of the disciplinary proceedings there should be a review dpc us on the date when the sealed cover procedure was followed and the review dpc should consider the findings in the sealed cover as also the penalty imposed it is not clear to us as to why the tribunal wants the review dpc to consider the penalty imposed while considering the findings in the sealed cover if according to the tribunal not giving effect to the findings in the sealed cover even when a penalty is imposed amounts to double jeopardy however as we read the findings of the tribunal it appears that the tribunal in no case wants the promotion of the officer to be deferred once the officer is visited with a penalty in the disciplinary proceedings and the tribunal desires that the officer should be given promotion as per the findings in the sealed cover\n",
      "23 according to us the tribunal has erred in holding that when an officer is found guilty in the discharge of his duties an imposition of penalty is all that is necessary to improve his conduct and to enforce discipline and ensure purity in the administration in the first instance the penalty short of dismissal will vary from reduction in rank to censure we are sure that the tribunal has not intended that the promotion should be given to the officer from the original date even when the penalty imparted is of reduction in rank on principle for the same reasons the officer cannot be rewarded by promotion as a matter of course even if the penalty is other than that of the reduction in rank an employee has no right to promotion he has only a right to be considered for promotion the promotion to a post and more so to a selection post depends upon several circumstances to qualify for promotion the least that is expected of an employee is to have an unblemished record that is the minimum expected to ensure a clean and efficient administration and to protect the public interests an employee found guilty of misconduct cannot be placed on par with the other employees and his case has to be treated differently there is therefore no discrimination when in the matter of promotion he is treated differently the least that is expected of any administration is that it does not reward an employee with promotion retrospectively from a date when for his conduct before that date he is penalised in presentii when an employee is held guilty and penalised and is therefore not promoted at least till the date on which he is penalised he cannot be said to have been subjected to a further penalty on that account a denial of promotion in such circumstances is not a penalty but a necessary consequence of his conduct in fact while considering an employee for promotion his whole record has to be taken into consideration and if a promotion committee takes the penalties imposed upon the employee into consideration and denies him the promotion such denial is not illegal and unjustified\n",
      "24 if further the promoting authority can take into consideration the penalty or penalties awarded to an employee in the past while considering his promotion and deny him promotion on that ground it will be irrational to hold that it cannot take the penalty into consideration when it is imposed at a later date because of the pendency of the proceedings although it is for conduct prior to the date the authority considers the promotion for these reasons we are of the view that the tribunal is not right in striking down the said portion of the second subparagraph after clause iii of paragraph 3 of the said memorandum we therefore set aside the said findings of the tribunal\n",
      "in the circumstances the conclusions arrived at by the full bench of the tribunal stand modified as above it is needless to add that the modifications which we have made above will equally apply to the memorandum of january 12 1988\n",
      "25 in the result in civil appeals nos 301987 302087 and 301688 which arise out of the decision of the full bench the division bench of the tribunal to which the matters are remanded by the full bench will dispose of the cases of the employees involved in the appeals in the light of what we have held hereinabove\n",

      "26 in this case no chargesheet was served on the respondent employee when the dpc met to consider the respondents promotion yet the sealed cover procedure was adopted the tribunal has rightly directed the authorities to open the sealed cover and if the respondent was found fit for promotion by the dpc to give him the promotion from the date his immediate junior shri m raja rao was promoted pursuant to the order dated april 30 1986 the tribunal has also directed the authorities to grant to the respondent all the consequential benefits the tribunal has further stated in the impugned order that its order would not mean that the disciplinary proceedings instituted against the respondentemployee should not go on we see no reason to interfere with this order the appeal therefore stands dismissed in the circumstances of the case however there will be no order as to costs\n",
      "civil appeal no 3021 of 1987\n",
      "27 in this case the dpc did not consider the case of the respondentemployee for crossing efficiency bar wef 14th september 1983 on the ground that disciplinary proceedings were contemplated against him we are therefore of the view that the tribunals direction that the dpc should be convened to consider the case of the respondent for crossing the efficiency bar wef 14th september 1983 on the basis of his confidential record at the relevant date and without reference to the contemplated disciplinary proceedings is both proper and valid in this case also the tribunal has given the said direction without prejudice to the right of the appellantauthorities to take any disciplinary action as might have been contemplated this order also does not require any interference from this court hence the appeal stands dismissed in the circumstances of the case however there will be no order as to costs\n",

      "28 in this case the respondentemployees case was considered for promotion by the dpc in august 1982 however the result was kept in a sealed cover in view of the pending disciplinary proceedings against him according to the employee on october 11 1985 the disciplinary proceedings ended in complete exoneration thereafter a dpc was again constituted in march 1986 which after consideration of the employees case recommended him for promotion wef july 26 1986 this was obviously contrary even to the instructions contained in the memorandum he was entitled to promotion from the date his immediate junior was promoted in or after august 1982 if he was in august 1982 found fit for promotion by the dpc the tribunal has therefore rightly directed the appellant to open the sealed cover and if the dpc in 1982 had found him fit for promotion to give him the promotion from the date on which his immediate junior was promoted however while doing so the tribunal has also directed arrears of salary to be paid for intervening period along with all consequential benefits\n",
      "since we have held disagreeing with the decision of the full bench of the tribunal that the benefit of the arrears of salary will not flow automatically but will depend upon the circumstances in each case we modify the said order to the extent it directs the payment of arrears of salary and direct the appellantauthority to consider whether the employee in the circumstances of the case was entitled to any arrears of salary and to what extent the authority will of course give reasons for denial of the whole or part of the arrears of salary the appeal is therefore allowed partly with no order as to costs\n",

      "29 in this case the respondentemployee was not recommended for promotion by the dpc in its meeting held on february1 1988 instead the dpc had kept the results in a sealed cover because of the pending disciplinary proceedings admittedly no chargememo was served on the employee till the date the dpc met on february 1 1988 it was issued only in march 2 1989 the tribunal has therefore rightly directed the authorities to open the sealed cover we are however unable to understand the direction of the tribunal to convene a review dpc for considering the employees case as on february 1 1988 if the dpc had considered the case of the employee on february 1 1988 and withheld the result because of the pending disciplinary proceedings the proper direction would have been to ask the appellantauthority to open the sealed cover and if the employee was found fit for promotion to direct the authority to promote him from the date on which his immediate junior was promoted as a result of the recommendation of the dpc on february 1 1988 in case he is so found fit he would be entitled to the benefits of seniority etc on a notional basis\n",
      "however whether he would be entitled to the arrears of salary for the intervening period and to what extent will have to be decided by the appellant authority in the light of what we have state above in case the authority denies to the employee the salary in full or in part it will of course record its reasons for doing so the appeal is therefore allowed partly as above with no order as to costs \n",

      "30 these appeals are filed against five respondentemployees disciplinary proceedings as well as criminal prosecution were launched against each of them for lodging false leave travel concession claims and for using forged documents to support them the employees were suspended from service on 15th july 1983 they admitted guilt and pleaded revocation of their suspension on depositing the amount of rs 1600 they were reinstated in service in november 1983 keeping in view the deposit of the amount voluntarily in october 1983 a lenient view was taken and the criminal prosecutions against them were dropped by the administration by an order of january 14 1985 however this was done without prejudice to the departmental proceedings which were subsequently initiated and the formal charge sheet was issued to the employees on december 24 1987\n",
      "31 the departmental promotion committee met in july 1986 to consider the cases of the employees for promotion but resorted to sealed cover procedure in view of the pendency of the disciplinary proceedings against them there is no dispute that the formal charge sheet was issued either on august or december 24 1987 conflicting months have been mentioned in the decision of the tribunal\n",
      "however we find that the tribunal has taken a mechanical view and applied the decision of the full bench and directed the promotions to be given to the employees on the basis of the recommendations if any of the dpc of july 1986 we are of the view that in the present case when the dpc met in july 1986 the committee had before it the record of the refund of the amount by the respondentemployees and the consequent withdrawal of the prosecutions without prejudice to the authorities right to institute departmental proceedings\n",
      "32 in view of the aforesaid peculiar facts of the present case the dpc which met in july 1986 was justified in resorting to the sealed cover procedure notwithstanding the fact that the chargesheet in the departmental proceedings was issued in augustdecember 1987 the tribunal was therefore not justified in mechanically applying the decision of the full bench to the facts of the present case and also in directing all benefits to be given to the employees including payment of arrears of salary we are of the view that even if the results in the sealed cover entitle the employees to promotion from the date their immediate juniors were promoted and they are therefore so promoted and given notional benefits of seniority etc the employees in no case should be given any arrears of salary the denial of the benefit of salary will of course be in addition to the penalty if any imposed on the employees at the end of the disciplinary proceedings we therefore allow these appeals as above with no order as to costs\n",

      "38 the tribunal has found fault with the authorities on two grounds the tribunal has observed that although when the dpc met in june 1988 the employee was already served with a chargesheet on february 22 1988 and therefore the sealed cover procedure could not be faulted since admittedly his juniors were given promotion with retrospective effect from july 30 1986 the dpc should not have excluded the respondents name from consideration when it met on june 3 1988 the second fault which the tribunal has found is that since the penalty of stoppage of increment was imposed at the end of the disciplinary proceedings it was not open for the authorities to deny the respondent his promotion to the selection grade as that amounted to double penalty having taken this view the tribunal has directed that a review dpc should consider the respondents case for promotion wef july 1986 when his juniors were given promotion taking into account his performance and confidential records up to 1986 we are afraid the tribunal has taken an erroneous view of the matter admittedly the dpc met in june 1988 when the employee was already served with the chargesheet on february 22 1988 the chargesheet was for misconduct for the period between 1982 and 1985 admittedly further the employee was punished by an order of august 19 1988 and his one increment was withheld\n",
      "39 although therefore the promotions to his juniors were given with retrospective effect from july 30 1986 the denial of promotion to the employee was not unjustified the dpc had for the first time met on june 3 1988 for considering promotion to the selection grade it is in this meeting that his juniors were given selection grade with retrospective effect from july 30 1986 and the sealed cover procedure was adopted in his case if no disciplinary proceedings were pending against him and if he was otherwise selected by the dpc he would have got the selection grade wef july 30 1986 but in that case the disciplinary proceedings against him for his misconduct for the earlier period viz between 1982 and 1985 would have been meaningless if the tribunals finding is accepted it would mean that by giving him the selection grade wef july 30 1986 he would stand rewarded notwithstanding his misconduct for the earlier period for which disciplinary proceedings were pending at the time of the meeting of the dpc and for which again he was visited with a penalty we therefore allow the appeal and set aside the finding of the tribunal there will however be no order as to costs\n",
