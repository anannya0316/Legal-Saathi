    "In short, the case involves an individual who was appointed as an Officer in a bank and was also involved in a society formed to construct residential premises for bank employees. There were allegations of misappropriation of funds in the society, leading to inquiries and criminal charges against the individual. The bank suspended the individual, terminated his services, and later refused to reinstate him even after he was acquitted of the criminal charges. The individual filed a writ petition in the High Court, seeking to quash the bank's orders. Initially, the Single Judge granted relief, but the Division Bench of the High Court disagreed and dismissed the petition, citing delays and considering the merits of the case. This led to an appeal to the higher court."
